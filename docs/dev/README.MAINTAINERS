Note: See top of README.DEVELOPERS for required
software; maintainers need the same software.

These instructions are for building a new lifelines 
release, in your working directory, and actually
releasing it.

PART 1 - Build and Test

Check out the latest code (or version branch) as required:
  $ git checkout master

Edit the version number, setting it to the new release:
(Running, eg, "cd build; sh setversions.sh 3.0.19; cd .." does this)
(NB: setversions.sh requires bash3)

Run autotools:
  $ sh autogen.sh

Build:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

Run and test using the st/st_all report:

  $ src/liflines/llines


PART 2 - Build and Package

Note: There are several reports which do not build
correctly in UTF-8 locale. Therefore, if you use
a UTF-8 locale, do something like so:
export LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-1

Ensure that the main repository is clean, or else this confuses the local build in ./bld:
  $ make distclean

Build local copy in ./bld subdirectory:
  $ rm -rf bld
  $ mkdir bld
  $ cd bld
  $ ../configure
  $ make

Build distribution tarball:
  $ make dist
  $ cd ..

PART 3 - Update and Merge

Add an entry mentioning the new version in the ChangeLog.

Commit changes (new version number, new message catalogs, ChangeLog):
$ git add ...
$ git commit

PART 4 - Package and Distribute

Build any other files (eg, other tarball formats,
MS-Windows binary packages, rpm packages).

rpm:  See README.MAINTAINERS.rpm

debian: lifelines is a supported debian package
         and has a debian maintainer.

FreeBSD: lifelines is a support FreeBsd port
         and has a FreeBSD maintainer.

MS-Windows: See README.MAINTAINERS.win32

Tag the repository at github using the version number used.

$ git tag X.Y.Z

Create a release at github, and upload the release packages.
(Should be at least a source tgz, but there could be Windows and MacOSX binaries).

PART 5 - Announce

Announce new version to Free Translation Project.
Per: http://translationproject.org/html/maintainers.html

<< Whenever you make a new release of your package, you should announce
   it to the TP coordinators at <coordinator@translationproject.org> by
   sending them the URL of the release tarball -- this tarball should
   contain an up to date POT file. >>

Send an announcement to the LINES-L mailing list
 (send to user LINES-L at domain LISTSERV.NODAK.EDU).
