1) Extract the lifelines zip, eg, to c:\ which should result in all
the lifelines programs & files appearing under c:\lifelines. If you
do not have a program such as WinZip to work with zip files, a good
free Open Source alternative is 7-Zip http://www.7-zip.org/.
NOTE: MS-Windows has the built-in capability to extract zip files,
but cannot create them.

2) If your root lifelines directory is not c:\lifelines, edit
lines.cfg and adjust the variable %llroot% accordingly.  Also, make
any necessary changes to other directory variables in the file, if
they are not correct for your setup.

3) If your editor does not use the default codeset for your version of
MS-Windows (which is CP-1252 for US English Windows), then set the
config variable EditorCodeset. The GUI codeset, and the locales,
should all be deduced correctly by lifelines at runtime from your
environment, so you do not need to set them.

4) If you want to use UTF-8 internally, enable the UTF-8 setting in
your lines.cfg (edit the entry NewDbProps). This is still under
development. If you wish to use just an 8-bit codeset internally, set
it the same way. It is necessary that you specify an internal codeset
for lifelines to do codeset conversion, and codeset conversion is
fairly necessary on MS-Windows, because the Console mode window uses a
different codeset than the rest of MS-Windows.

5) The configuration file, lines.cfg, allows the user to specify
values to use when the program is started. In addition to the
configuration settings mentioned in items 2, 3, and 4 above, the
user can enter any kind of value in this file for later retrieval
by a report. There are five "standard" user properties that are
consistent for all the reports included with LifeLines. For the
reports that have a place for this information, it allows the
configuration file to be edited once, rather than editing each report.

Please note that if you change the lines.cfg file while LifeLines
is open, you will need to quit and re-start for LifeLines to read
the changes. See the ll-userguide in the Documentation folder, and
the lines.cfg file itself for more information on configuration
file settings.

The "standard" lines.cfg settings are:

user.fullname=Firstname Lastname
user.address=123 My Street\nMy City, ST 12345
user.phone=123-456-7890
user.email=me@myemailaddress.com
user.url=http://www.mywebsite.com/

See item 10 in the Run.LifeLines.Windows.txt for a report to test
these values.

6) To create a shortcut for Lifelines, open a Windows explorer window
(eg, right-click on "My Computer" and choose Explore), browse to your
program directory from step (2) (eg, \Program Files\LifeLines),
right-click on the executable (Lines.exe) left-click Send To, another
menu will appear, left-click Desktop (create shortcut). This creates
your desktop shortcut to run the program.

7) Right-click on the new shortcut icon on your desktop, and choose
Rename. Adjust the name as you like (eg, to LifeLines).

8) LifeLines on Windows does not always fit all the text on the
visible part of the console window without scrolling. For example,
on a 1024 x 768 screen resolution, right-click the shortcut then
left-click properties and left-click the Layout tab and change the
values of the window size to a width of 80 and a height of about 59
allows all the menu options to fit in the console window without
scrolling. For different resolutions, different values will be needed.

Now you are ready to run LifeLines: refer to the
Run.LifeLines.Windows.txt document in the LifeLines Documentation
directory.
