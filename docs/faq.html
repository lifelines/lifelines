<h2><a name="A01">1. What is LifeLines?</a></h2>
<p>LifeLines is a free and open source genealogy program to help with
your family history research. It has native versions for Unix-like,
Mac, and Windows operating systems.</p>

<p>The format of the data as presented to the user for viewing, data entry, and updating follows the GEDCOM format.</p>

<p>The real power of LifeLines is its scripting ability. There are a
number of LifeLines reports (aka scripts) that generate all manner of
output -- ahnentafels, ancestor/descendent reports, formatted ancestor
reports, beautiful books of all ancestors, fan charts of ancestors,
vital records of all individuals in a format suitable for importing to
palm pilot databases (specifically DB which is also hosted here on
SourceForge). All the reports are included in the kit.</p>

<p>Several reports can do error and sanity checking of data; such as deaths before births, extreme May-December marriages, etc.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A04">4. Who wrote LifeLines?</a></h2>
<p>Lifelines was written by Tom Wetmore circa 1991-1994 and he has now
placed it under an MIT-style license. Tom no longer works on LifeLines,
but does occasionally participate on the LINES-L mailing list. His
original website was http://www.bartonstreet.com/software/lines but is
no longer valid. Historians can visit the <a href="http://www.waybackmachine.org/">wayback machine</a> if they desire to see it.</p>

<p>Currently, LifeLines is maintained and enhanced by a team of dedicated volunteers on SourceForge.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A05">5. How much does LifeLines cost?</a></h2>
LifeLines is free.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A06">6. How do I submit a bug report?</a></h2>
<p>Post it to the <a href="mailto:LINES-L@LISTSERV.NODAK.EDU">LINES-L</a> list, and then, if you do not see a response saying that it is resolved in a week or so, post it to the <a href="http://github.com/lifelines/lifelines/issues">LifeLines issues list</a>.</p>

<p>If you have multiple items to report, rather than one large email to
the list, please submit them individually via the SourceForge bug list.</p>

<p>Having small, concisely defined work items makes it easy for the
volunteer programmers to sit down and knock off a couple of them in an
hour or two some evening.</p>

<p>When submitting a bug report some items are always useful to include:</p>

<p>Operating System:<br>
Version of LifeLines:<br>
Process/Report/Documentation you used:</p>

<p>If you find a problem with a report, it is often helpful to contact
the report author(s). Usually their name and email address is in the
comments of the report.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A07">7. How do I request a new feature be added to LifeLines?</a></h2>
Post it to the <a href="mailto:LINES-L@LISTSERV.NODAK.EDU">LINES-L</a> list, or add it on the <a href="http://github.com/lifelines/lifelines/issues">Lifelines issues list</a>.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A08">8. How do I update or add a report I wrote to the repository?</a></h2>
<p>If you are a programmer on the project, you have access to do this via CVS.</p>

<p>If you are not a programmer on the project: (This works for reports, documentation, and even coding changes.)</p>

<p>Post a new patch on the LifeLines GitHub site, saying that it
is a new version of 'X', and what is changed or fixed or improved, on
the patch list, and then edit the patch and attach (upload) your file
to it.</p>

<p>Go here</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/lifelines/lifelines/issues">http://github.com/lifelines/lifelines/issues</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;and submit a new issue with your patches attached.</p>

<p>Then post a note to the <a href="mailto:LINES-L@LISTSERV.NODAK.EDU">LINES-L</a> list saying you have done that, and someone will review it and merge it.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A09">9. What text editors work with LifeLines?</a></h2>
<p>Any text editor will work with LifeLines, for example vim or emacs on Unix-like systems, or Notepad on Windows.</p>

<p>Vim and emacs are also available for Windows and many other operating systems.</p>

<p>You may also specify your favorite text editor.</p>

<p>If you use a text editor with a tabbed interface, e.g. NoteTab on
Windows, or gedit or Bluefish on Unix-like systems, you will want to
use an instance that does not require multiple tabs. This is because
the text editor must be closed once the edits or new entries are
finished to send a signal to LifeLines that there is something for it
to do, i.e. save your changes.</p>

<p>vim: <a href="http://www.vim.org/">http://www.vim.org/</a></p>

<p>emacs: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/</a></p>

<p>NoteTab: <a href="http://www.notetab.com/">http://www.notetab.com/</a></p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A10">10. How do I close the text editor and return to the menu?</a></h2>
The program has done a system() command to spawn the editor, and is
waiting for the process to end. Once your edits are finished, save your
work and close the editor. LifeLines will then ask if you want to save
your work.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A11">11. Where do I get the LifeLines FAQ?</a></h2>
<p>The LifeLines FAQ may be obtained from the LifeLines website:<br>
<a href="http://lifelines.github.io/lifelines/docs/faq.html">http://lifelines.github.io/lifelines/docs/faq.html</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A12">12. How do I report errors in the FAQ/suggest new items?</a></h2>
Suggestions and corrections for the LifeLines FAQ may be sent to the <a href="mailto:LINES-L@LISTSERV.NODAK.EDU">LINES-L@LISTSERV.NODAK.EDU</a> or directed to the <a href="mailto:LifeLinesFAQ@gmail.com">editor</a> of the FAQ.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A13">13. What is a text editor?</a></h2>A text editor
is a program for editing plain text. It is not a word-processor, like
MS-Word or Open Office Write. A text editor does not do bold, italics,
or other formats to the text. Text editors also tend to be small
programs that are fast to load.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A14">14. Is syntax highlighting available?</a></h2>Two
editors that have both Unix-like and Windows versions have LifeLines
Reports syntax highlighting and GEDCOM syntax highlighting. They are
emacs and vim. A default set of syntax files are included with vim.
There are syntax files for both emacs and an enhanced one for vim under
tools on the LifeLines home page: <a href="http://lifelines.github.io/lifelines">http://lifelines.github.io/lifelines</a>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A15">15. How do I install LifeLines on Windows?</a></h2>
Please refer to the file Install.LifeLines.Windows.txt. This is
included with the distribution and has details for installing LifeLines
on Windows.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A16">16. How do I get started with LifeLines on Windows?</a></h2>
Please refer to the file Run.LifeLines.Windows.txt. This is included with the distribution and has details for getting started.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A17">17. I need a report to do X.</a></h2>
<p>Please review the index.html file in the Reports directory. This
will explain all of the reports included with LifeLines. If you need
something not covered by the standard reports, you can write your own.
See the ll-reportmanual in the docs directory. You can also look at the
included reports. They are text files, so you can open them in any text
editor.</p>

<p>If you need help writing a report, you can ask for help on the LINES-L discussion list.</p>

<p>One way to develop your own reports is to find a report script that
does something similar to what you want to do, then copying in under a
different name, then modifying it until its behavior approximates the
desired behavior sufficiently.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A18">18. What is GEDCOM?</a></h2>
<p>GEDCOM is an acronym for GEnealogical Data COMmunication. It is a
specially organized text file for organizing genealogy data. This is
the format that LifeLines uses to import and export your information.
It is also the way that data is added or edited using a text editor.</p>

<p>You can read more about the history, current state, and future of GEDCOOM at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>LifeLines allows the user to get the full benefit of the GEDCOM specification in recording and retrieving data.</p>

<p>See the ll-userguide in the LifeLines docs directory for an
explanation of adding the first person to an empty database, and other
examples.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A19">19. Does LifeLines support XML?</a></h2>
LifeLines cannot import XML, such as the GEDCOM 6.0 draft. However,
there are reports included with the distribution that can write data to
XML. LifeLines is tied to GEDCOM for storing data, so it would take a
lot of work, most likely a total re-write to support importing XML.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A20">20. Can I include binary data such as graphics, sound, or video?</a></h2>
<p>LifeLines programmers do not recommend using the BLOB (binary data encoded as text) in GEDCOMs.</p>

<p>A better, more flexible choice is OBJE in the GEDCOM standard (chapter 2). The other option is to just reference the file:</p>

<p>1 OBJE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 FILE images/dum/SteveDum.jpg<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 FORM JPG<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 TITL Steve Dum<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 DATE May 1999</p>

<p>Reasons why adding encoded binary data to a GEDCOM file is NOT recommended:</p>

<p>According to the GEDCOM standard you cannot uuencode the binary
data. &nbsp;It has to be in the GEDCOM blob format. &nbsp;I have only
seen one example of it, the stuff in the tortue test and I haven't been
able to decode it.<br>
Now to confirm the stupidity of including binary data in a GEDCOM,<br>
the 5.5.1 GEDCOM standard (draft release) dropped blob's.<br>
So, on this item<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. GEDCOM 5.5 defines a unique to GEDCOM encoding standard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We are not aware of any programs to encode/decode the data.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Actually using this would inflate GEDCOMs terribly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. They dropped this capability in the next draft of the standard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shouldn't recommend using it. </p>

<p>The GEDCOM standard also allows you to include embedded multimedia
objects (each fragment of the encoded binary may be up to 32KB in size)
(see the MULTIMEDIA_LINK reference in the GEDCOM 5.5 standard). In
LifeLines though, you have to encode the binary image/sound/video as a
text file yourself with an external program before including it in the
INDI/FAM record.</p>

<p>The usefulness of embedded multimedia objects in LifeLines is
probably quite limited because you need to decode the object (image)
when running the report to give sensible output, which would not be
trivial (need temporary files etc). GEDCOM uses its own encoding
scheme. &nbsp;It's defined in Appendix E of the GEDCOM 5.5 standard.
&nbsp;It's very similar to mime encoding but of course uses a different
character mapping. All the more reason to keep the objects separate.</p>

<p>The following example of what an encoded multimedia object looks like<br>
in a GEDCOM file that comes from the GEDCOM Torture Test Files at<br>

</p><h2><a name="A21">21. How do I protect the privacy of information I collect?</a></h2>
<p>Reports should have a privacy option that can be enabled/disabled
depending on usage so that private information is not inadvertently
disseminated.</p>

<p>GEDCOM supports a restriction tag (RESN). It allows data to be
signified as confidential, locked, or private. For the purposes of
LifeLines and data privacy, use the 'confidential' value for the RESN
tag as explained below.</p>

<p>The information protected should be names, dates, events and dates.
Reports should have the option of altering the name, say John Smith
-&gt; Living Smith. GEDCOM output should add a 1 RESN privacy record to
the individual.</p>

<p>This should be done in 3 situations:<br>
1. Any INDI, FAM, or Event records marked with a RESN tag with value 'confidential'.<br>
2. Any INDI presumed living - i.e. born in the last 110 years with no death date present.<br>
3. Any Family information if the Husband or Wife is assumed living.</p>

<p>The gettext manual describes how to use emacs to do translation of po files. there is also a standalone editor <a href="http://www.poedit.org/">poEdit</a>
on SourceForge specifically for translating po files. From the poEdit
help file: "poEdit serves as a front-end to gettext. It allows you to
edit catalog files in [a] comfortable way."</p>

<p>The basic process is to add the translation for each message or label in the appropriate place. This results in the po file.</p>

<p>Once complete, the po file is processed to become a binary mo file. It can then be added to the list of LifeLines translations.</p>

<p>Certain kinds of problems, such as the wrong sex for a HUSB and WIFE
record in a Marriage record, would cause problems later. You should get
an errs.log report detailing the line number and the INDI record with
the problem. Correct these problems in your GEDCOM and then try again.</p>

<p>If you are not getting the errs.log, check your LifeLines
configuration file to make sure you are looking in the right place for
the errs.log, and that the errs.log is turned on. By default the import
errors log file is off. If you activate it, the default name is
errs.log, but you may specify a different name in the configuration
file.</p>

<p>If you try to import a GEDCOM with non-traditional families, i.e.
something other than one man (HUSB) and one woman (WIFE) and their
children, the import process will issue a warning message, but it will
continue and import the file assuming there where no other errors. </p>

</p><h2><a name="A35">35. I want to keep the same INDI and FAM record numbers as are in my GEDCOM.</a></h2>
<p>According to the GEDCOM specification, the program is supposed to
have control of the INDI, FAM, SOUR, and REPO ID numbers. The user can
use numbers and/or letters in the REFN to be whatever ID number the
user wants. However, if there are no REFN records in your GEDCOM, you
will get the prompt asking if you want to keep the existing numbers. </p>

<p>If you load into a NEW database, and you have sequential numbering
for INDI and FAM records without gaps (i.e. I1, I2, I3, F1, F2, I4, F3)
this will not be a problem. However, if one INDI or FAM record is
missing, or they are not sequential, LL will renumber them where the
gap begins.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A36">36. I get a message that a reference number is already in use.</a></h2>
If your database was created with a GEDCOM with multiple REFNs with the
same information, you will get this message. To edit the records with
the REFNs, you will need to change the REFN of the record to be unique
or delete the line with the REFN. The REFN is supposed to be a
user-defined identification for an INDI or FAM record. They can be
number, letters or both.

<p>LifeLines settings can be stored in the LifeLines configuration

switches.</p>

<p>The command line switches can be specified in a shell script or batch file.</p>

<p>Some options can also be stored in a specific database.</p>

<p>See 'System and User Properties' in the ll-userguide.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A40">40. How many databases can I have?</a></h2>
<p>LifeLines databases are stored in a directory under the LifeLines
Databases directory. The only limitation to the total number of
databases is available disk space.</p>

<p>Multiple databases can be open simultaneously, only limited by
system resources. This will vary by specifics of hardware, operating
system, and size of databases.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A41">41. What is the maximum size of a LifeLines database?</a></h2>
<p>LifeLines can easily support databases of over 100,000 individuals with a total size of 30 megabytes. </p>

<p>The limit is 9,999,999 individuals or families. &nbsp;The internal
keys for Individuals, families, sources, notes, etc., are kept as a 8
character string, one letter and at most 7 digits. There are some
assumptions built into the hash tables that definitely favor small
tables. &nbsp;The hash is hard wired to hash on 512 elements. &nbsp;So
operations that build large tables will degrade to long linear
searches. &nbsp;This can be avoided by switching to rbtrees (controlled
by the LifeLines configuration file).</p>

<p>This could easily be 150 MB in size. However, the larger the file,
the longer it will take to import and export data. It is recommended
that several smaller databases be used than one huge one, to simplify
the import and export process. </p>

<p>Also keep in mind the need for space for backups and reports. Reports for the entire database could be quite large.</p>

<p>One LifeLine's user conducted a test in November, 2005, by importing
the same GEDCOM of 250,000 individuals multiple times, to get a total
of 2,500,000 individuals. Once imported, this huge database was almost
as fast to look up information as one of 250,000. The GEDCOM exported
from this database was 700 MB. It is estimated that this database with
9,000,000 individuals would have a GEDCOM of about 2 GB. The LifeLines
database is approximately the same size as the GEDCOM. This test took
several days of processing to accomplish. So while it is possible, with
the current database used, it is not practical. The upper practical
limit of individuals is about 250,000 depending on one's patience for
loading such a GEDCOM.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A42">42. I exported a GEDCOM on Linux and Windows and the Linux database is a lot smaller.</a></h2>
Do not worry, you have not lost any data. Unix and Linux text files use
one byte for the end of line, but Windows uses two bytes. On a 4.9 MB
GEDCOM on Windows of about 235,000 lines, you will find it to be 4.6
MB, because it is "missing" one byte at the end of each line on Unix
and Linux.
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A43">43. I dual-boot Linux and Windows (or x and y), can I swap my database between partitions?</a></h2>
<p>Yes. Linux/Unix and Windows on the same endianness, usually the same
processor family, such as Intel/AMD, will work if you copy the
LifeLines database, or have it on a shared drive. You can even transfer
the file to another computer with the same endianness/type of processor
and it should work. Be sure to test this before relying on it for
important data.</p>

<p>For complete portability, export your file to GEDCOM.</p>

<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A44">44. What is the directory structure of LifeLines?</a></h2>
<p>LifeLines has the following directory structure:</p>

<p>On Unix-like systems LifeLines is located here:</p>

<p>/home/username/lifelines/</p>

<p>On Windows it is usually:</p>

<p>C:\LifeLines\</p>

<p>The following directory structure is on both Windows and Unix-like systems:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/Archives &nbsp;&nbsp;(GEDCOM files are exported here by default.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/Databases &nbsp;(Each database is a directory in this directory.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/tt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Codeset information.)</p>

<p>On Windows the reports directory is in the same location as all the others:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/Programs (name of the reports directory)</p>

<p>On Unix-like systems, the reports are installed to:</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/lifelines</p>

<p>Users on Unix-like systems will either need permissions to this directory to edit reports, or their own local copy of reports.</p>

<p>NOTE: These directories may be renamed to suit your personal
preference, and then specified in your LifeLines configuration file(s).</p>

<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A45">45. How do I back up my data?</a></h2>
<p>The best way is to export to GEDCOM. This is a text file with
specially organized data. This is the most accessible format for your
data, because you can open it in a text editor, or import it into
another genealogy program.</p>

<p>Another option is to compress (zip, gzip, etc.) the Databases directory or an individual database in the Databases directory.</p>

<p>Some may want a low-tech backup of their data on paper. Print these
reports on high-quality acid-free paper for long-life and prevent
fading. Reports that are good for getting all information on an entire
branch of your tree are:</p>

<p>novel.ll - This creates a narrative. If you start with your end of
line (eol) ancestor, it will give all descendants. You will need to
edit to avoid duplicating the individuals that are on reports in each
line. This would make a good gift to family, and maybe get them
inclined to share information.</p>

<p>famgroup.ll - Family groups sheets.</p>

<p>famrep.ll - Exports family group sheets. Has an option to do all
families of the starting ancestor. Use your eol ancestor to get all
descendants. It includes footnotes with sources. You will need to edit
to avoid duplicating the individuals that are on reports in each line.
These are good for sending to family and fellow researchers, to verify
and fill in the blanks. </p>

<p>Another possible repository is with your local library, genealogy
society, historical society, a surname society, etc. This insures that
your hard work to prepare an accurate, verified family history is not
lost to the ages when you die. Make a provision for this in your will
if your family does not have anyone to take up the torch. Future
researchers will thank you.</p>

reports, individual reports, and error checking reports. The user is
also free to write reports for their own needs.</p>

<p>On Unix-like systems, the reports are located here:</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/lifelines</p>

<p>On Windows systems the reports are located here:</p>

</p><h2><a name="A53">53. How can LifeLines help me clean up my data?</a></h2>
<p>1.) When you import your GEDCOM, LifeLines will alert you to
problems that may prevent it from importing. Once these are corrected
and you are able to import your GEDCOM you will know that there are no
major technical issues with your GEDCOM.</p>

<p>2.) Once you import your GEDCOM, run the dbverify program to check for errors. </p>

<p>For example, the following command will generate a text file of all problems in your database.:</p>

<p>Unix/Linux:</p>

<p>dbverify -a "/home/username/LifeLines/Databases/databasename" &gt; dbverifyLL.txt</p>

<p>Windows:</p>

<p>dbverify -a "C:\LifeLines\Databases\databasename" &gt; dbverifyLL.txt</p>

<p>dbverify --help will give a list of all the command line options.</p>

<p>3.) Once the problems identified by dbverify, if any, have been
resolved, there are several reports in the LifeLines distribution that
are very helpful for finding problems.</p>

<p>verify.ll will look for age issues, such as children born before
parents, or dying before birth. It also reports non-patronymic names,
i.e. children that do not have the same surname as the father.
Verify.ll can find many other issues, please see the comments in this
report for specifics.</p>

<p>places.ll will generate a report of all the places in your database
that can be sorted. This helps you make sure all spellings are correct,
and that all places include the county.</p>

<p>zombies.ll will generate a report of all individuals over 100 years old without a death date.</p>

<p>partition.ll will generate a report of the separate "partitions" or non-connected lines in your database.</p>

<p>nonpatronymics.ll will show which children do not have the same surname as their father.</p>

<p>familycheck.ll checks to make sure that all INDI records are in a FAM and that all FAM records have INDIs.</p>

<p>eol.ll produces a report of all the "End of Line" AKA brick wall ancestors of a given individual.</p>

<p>dates.ll produces a report of all dates in the database to help find dates that are wrong or have an invalid format.</p>

<p>burial_index.ll generates a list of all burial records for requested geographic entity, such as a state or county.</p>

<p>alive.ll gives a list of individuals alive in a given year, to help determine what census to check, etc.</p>

<p>cont.ll lists individuals with possible problems with NOTE records.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A54">54. How do I recover a corrupt database?</a></h2>
<p>1. Before you do anything else, save your data by exporting the
GEDCOM make copies of everything, and work with a copy. &nbsp;Once you
have fixed the problem, it is easy to delete a few extra copies of the
data, but if something causes more corruption, you do not want to
destroy your only copy of the data.</p>

<p>2. Run dbverify to see if it can repair your data.</p>

<p>The following command will generate a text file of all problems in your database.:</p>

<p>Unix/Linux:</p>

<p>dbverify -a "/home/username/LifeLines/Databases/databasename" &gt; dbverifyLL.txt</p>

<p>Windows:</p>

<p>dbverify -a "C:\LifeLines\Databases\databasename" &gt; dbverifyLL.txt</p>

<p>dbverify --help will give a list of all the command line options.</p>

<p>3. Read in the exported GEDCOM to a new database.</p>

<p>4. Resolve any import issues, export data again to new GEDCOM.</p>

<p>5. If you have a backup see if the exported GEDCOM matches the previous one.</p>

<p>LifeLines allows bending the GEDCOM 5.5 rules that there can be only
one HUSB and one WIFE. &nbsp;This behavior requires a command line
option, except that importing a GEDCOM with non-traditional families is
allowed - you just get warnings.</p>

<p>Start LifeLines with the -n option.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A56">56. Where is the Configuration File?</a></h2>
<p>On Unix-like systems the configuration file is .linesrc. On these
Operating Systems, the dot as the first character in a filename
indicates a hidden file. This file is in the users home directory, for
example, /home/username/.linesrc.</p>

<p>To edit this file, using vim for example, you can open a command line and type vim /home/username/.linesrc.</p>

<p>Unix-like systems will look for the configuration file in three places.</p>

<p>1) system default location<br>
2) in home directory<br>
3) in current directory.</p>

<p>All 3 are read if they exist.</p>

<p>
On Windows, the file is called lines.cfg and is in the LifeLines directory, for example: c:\LifeLines\lines.cfg.</p>

<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A60">60. Can I merge 2 individuals/families?</a></h2>
<p>Yes, use the Tandem browse mode to bring up the two individuals or
families. Certain specific conditions must be met for the merge to
work. Please see the ll-userguide for details.</p>

<p>The bottom individual or family will be the one to "go away" after the merge.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A61">61. How do I combine two databases/GEDCOMs?</a></h2>
<p>Merging genealogy information is a complex task involving a great
deal of human interaction to be accurate and successful - eg. names and
places may have slightly different spellings or dates may be slightly
different. LifeLines allows you to match and merge two individual
records &nbsp;(see: <a href="#A60">Can I merge 2 individuals/families?</a>
), but currently does not have any built-in functionality to
automatically match large numbers of records and merge two databases.</p>

<p>However, several options exist:</p>

<p>1. Cut and paste information from one GEDCOM to LifeLines one record
at a time. This is the least error-prone method, and avoids creating
duplicate individuals or families. It also allows the user to indicate
multiple opinions on names, dates, and places.</p>

<p>2. Export both databases to GEDCOM and use an external matching program (such as Steve Dum's Perl script).</p>

<p>3. The most difficult of all, import the GEDCOM into a COPY of your
LifeLines database and merge each duplicate person/family one at a time.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A62">62. How do I change the order of children?</a></h2>
Inevitably, you will find that you have entered the children of a
family in the order you were given, only to find documentation that
proves the birth order/date is different. There are two ways to change
the order of children in a family. The first is to browse to the family
and edit the family record and change the order of the children (1 CHIL
@Innnn@) in that family. The second is to.browse to one of the parents
and enter family mode, g. Then press x "Swap two children".

</p><h2><a name="A63">63. How do I change the order of families?</a></h2>If
you have the order of families/marriages out of order, there are two
ways to change the order of families. The first is to browse to one of
the spouses and change the order of the families (1 FAMS @Fnnnn@) the
individual is a spouse. The second is to.browse to an individual and if
there are more than one spouse use the option x "Swap two families".

</p><h2><a name="A64">64. Can I make lists?</a></h2>Lists can be made
from the browse menu. For example, you can browse for the surname
/Smith/ and everyone in your database with that name will be displayed.
You can then make a list and call it Smith. <p>

<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A66">66. Can I link records together the way I want?</a></h2>
GEDCOM provides the REFN for user-defined codes. These may be
associated with the following records: INDI, FAM, SOUR, and REPO. For
example, with SOUR records one could use a shorthand for a source that
will be repeated with great frequency. This would allow you to generate
reports on the INDI and/or FAM records that use the same source.

<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A67">67. Some reports are not sorted, how do I sort them?</a></h2>
<p>If the output of a LifeLines report is not sorted as you'd like,
there are several, freely available programs that you can use to sort
the data. For example, the sort utility is included in both Windows and
Unix-like systems.</p>

<p>Unix-like, and Windows systems have their version of the sort utility, with very similar syntax.</p>

<p>Unix-like systems: </p>

<p>sort -f originalfilename -o sortedfilename</p>

<p>sort <originalfilename>sortedfilename</originalfilename></p>

<p>Windows: </p>

<p>sort originalfilename /O sortedfilename</p>

<p>The above examples keep the original filename and output the sorted information to a new file.</p>
<p>
<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A68">68. Can I use multiple configuration files for different purposes?</a></h2>
<p>If you want to use a configuration file other than the default
LifeLines configuration use the -C (NOTE: UPPERCASE!) command line
option and the path to the configuration file.</p>

<p>For example, you can have the "every day" file use the default
configuration, and then have a special configuration file for alternate
record templates.</p>

<p>A configuration file can read in other configuration files. &nbsp;So you can have even more complex situations.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A69">69. How can I shrink my GEDCOM?</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple possibilities.</p>

<p>If your other genealogy program exports GEDCOM with a "_UID" tag
that is a string of 50 plus characters, you can use grep or sed to
strip those lines out:</p>

<p>grep -v '^! UID' oldfile.ged &gt;newfile.ged</p>

<p>or just edit "old.ged" with vi, then (after ensuring that the cursor is at line 1 of the file) type</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!Ggrep -v '^1 _UID'</p>

<p>sed '/^1 _UID/d' source.ged &gt; destination.ged</p>

<p>DOS users will probably have to use double quotes instead of single quotes.</p>

<p>See the Sourceforge Project at: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>This project has command line tools for Windows ported from Unix. </p>

<p>Another option for shrinking your GEDCOM is to convert the line
endings to Unix\Linux line endings. Windows line ending have two
characters and Unix like Operating Systems have one character. On Unix
like Operating Systems, use this command:</p>

<p>dos2unix MyGEDCOM.ged</p>

<p>The gnuwin32 project also has a Windows version of dos2unix, and its
converse unix2dos. On Windows, you will want to use an editor that can
cope with the one character line endings, or your lines will not appear
to break at the proper place.</p>

<p>The last option, is one of prevention, and is time-consuming if you
are not already doing this. Make sure to minimize duplicate
information. Learn to use the source and repository tags to point facts
back to sources, so you can use a pointer rather than the whole source
citation. Make sure you do not have sources listed in NOTE records, and
that NOTE records do not repeat identical information for multiple
family members. </p>

</p><h2><a name="A70">70. How do I find information in specific tags?</a></h2>

<b>[ <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a> ]</b>


</p><h2><a name="A71">71. Can I distribute my database on a CDROM, and if so can it be viewed?</a></h2>
<p>Yes, you can distribute your database on a CDROM.</p>

<p>Privacy Note: You may wish to be careful distributing data about
living persons, or any private data, as genealogical data often finds
its way into large online repositories, becoming essentially public
knowledge. Sometimes unscrupulous people find data on the Internet and
misrepresent it as their own research, and may even try to sell it as
such.</p>

<p>The recipient of the CDROM will be able to use LifeLines to view the
database if the recipient uses the same type of computer as you do, or
at least one whose processor has the same endianness (see Endianness
NOTE below).</p>

<p>If the recipient copies the database off the CDROM onto a local drive, it should work fine.</p>

<p>The recipient will only be able to run LifeLines directly against a
LifeLines database on a CDROM if one of the following is true:<br>
1) the receipient invokes LifeLines with the -i option (immutable, which works with readonly filesystems)<br>
2) the sender prepared the database for access on a readonly medium, using the -ly (lock) argument (this is recommended)</p>

<p>Two other good ways to distribute the data on a CDROM are:<br>
a) in HTML form, probably in multiiple HTML files; after all, most recipients will have a web browser<br>
b) in GEDCOM form--this is useful for recipients who may want to import the data into another genealogy program</p>

<p>It might be best to include several, or all, of these formats, in your CDROM.</p>

<p>In addition, some genealogy programs (including LifeLines and
others) are free and freely redistributable, so you might even include
some genealogy programs on the CDROM, for recipients who have none.</p>

<p>The GRAMPS Project has developed two CDs, a Linux Live CD and a
Linux Install CD based on the Ubuntu Linux distribution. It includes
popular Linux related genealogy software, including LifeLines. Please
see the <a href="http://gramps-project.org/">GRAMPS Project</a> for more information and support issues with these two CDs.</p>

<p>Endianness NOTE:<br>
Big-endian computers can share databases with each other, and inclue SPARC, Power PC (PPC), and Mac.<br>
Little-endian computers can share databases with each other, and include Intel (x86) and AMD.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A73">73. Can I run LifeLines on a USB drive?</a></h2>
<p>If you use the USB drive on the same Operating System, yes, or have Wine to run a Windows version on a Unix-like system.</p>

<p>If you just have the database, you are only limited by the endianness/processor family.</p>

<p>For example, if you have Windows at work and at home, you can have
your entire LifeLines directory structure and database on the USB drive.</p>

<p>With Unix-like systems, this is probably easier to accomplish with just the database directory on USB.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A74">74. Should I put all my work into one lifelines database, or into several?</a></h2>
<p>The benefit of one database is that you can easily get a report of
any one person, family, or line in the database. LifeLines has a huge
capacity that is more practical for most users. </p>

<p>Another advantage of a big database is that it facilitates
determining relationships between arbitrary people in the database (see
the cousins.ll, relate.ll, and relation.ll reports).</p>

<p>See: <a href="#A41">What is the maximum size of a LifeLines database?</a></p>

<p>The benefit of many smaller databases, is that they can be focused
and take less effort to get reports on just that line. They are also
smaller and tend to be more portable.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A78">78. How can I use special characters in names etc.?</a></h2>
<p>To use special characters (that is, non-ASCII characters) in your
LifeLines database, you must set the codeset in the database. This
tells LifeLines what these characters mean.</p>

<p>The LifeLines developers recommend that you set the codeset to
UTF-8, because that is the form of Unicode used widely on the Internet
and on the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>There is a brief section on this topic in the usermanual, entitled "CODESET".</p>

<p>There is a configuration option (NewDbProps) which will set this for
all new databases which you create (refer to this property in your
configuration file).</p>

<p>To check the codeset information in your current database, go to Utilities and then the Character set options: u &gt; c.</p>

<p>Encoding issues in reports and output GEDCOM is a more complex
topic. The usermanual has a somewhat cryptic discussion of this topic
in the section entitled "CODESET CONVERSION".</p>

<p>Translations of LifeLines (e.g., into Swedish), are separate from
the codeset. These are controlled by locale, and may be overriden in
the configuration file: see the ll-userguide for details.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A79">79. What programs are included with the LifeLines Distribution?</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the main LifeLines binary, llines on Unix-like
systems and lines.exe on Windows, there are (NOTE: Add .exe for the
Windows filenames.):</p>

<p>llexec - This program is for running a LifeLines Report of the
user's choice at the command line. Executing the command "llexec -h" at
a command prompt gives the same option as with "lines -h" on Windows or
"llines -h" on Unix-like systems. See also: <a href="#A49">What are the command line options?</a></p>

<p>dbverify - This program is used to check and repair LifeLines
databases. At a command prompt use the command "dbverify -h" to get a
complete help listing and example of use.</p>

<p>btedit - This is for programmers or advanced users to work with the
LifeLines database directly. When the command "btedit -h" is given at a
command console, it gives a brief usage example: </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usage: btedit <btree> <rkey></rkey></btree></p>

<p>In addition, all LifeLines Reports are mini-programs or scripts, but they only work with LifeLines. With the exception of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jlifelines">JLifeLines</a>, and the perl script, lines2perl, which converts LifeLines Reports for use with the perl module <a href="http://www.pjcj.net/perl.html#Gedcom.pm">Gedcom.pm</a>.
NOTE: lines2perl has fallen behind the current LifeLines implementation
so any functions which have been added to the language since the
creation of lines2perl are unknown.</p>

<p>For Windows users, Perl can be obtained from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Perl.plex?hdr=1">Activestate</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdbi">GDBI - GEDCOM DataBase Interface</a>, uses jLifeLines to access the functionality of LifeLines Reports.</p>

<p>LifeLines can export data to a variety of formats: text, HTML, XML, RTF, PS, NROFF, LaTeX, and many others. </p>

<p>Some operating systems, such as Windows, will not include all the

<p>Reports can be run in a variety of ways, within the program the p
option allows you to browse the list of available reports. The r option
allows the user to enter the name of the desired report to be run. </p>

<p>When the -x option is used, the user can specify a specific report to be run from the commandline.</p>

<p>There is an additional utility, llexec, that is designed solely for running reports from the command line.</p>

<p>If the report doesn't ask any questions:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;llexec data -x report<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is all it takes.</p>

<p>If it asks questions, either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;llexec data -x report<br>

and how to use it. In addition, there is an index.html file in the
Programs/Reports directory that has a listing of each report and a
brief description. There are currently over 150 reports.</p>

<p>Reports are actually mini programs that are just text files with special coding that tell LifeLines how to operate on the data.</p>

<p>For details of working with writing or modifying reports, see the ll-reportmanual, and look at the existing reports.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A82">82. What do reports do?</a></h2>
<p>Reports are actually mini programs that allow the user to get
information out of a database in a desired format. Over 150 reports are
included in the distribution.</p>

<p>Refer to the ll-reportmanual for details on the LifeLines Report Language.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A83">83. How do I keep my customizations of reports from being overwritten when there is an update to LifeLines?</a></h2>
<p>One simple option, if you just modify a few reports, is to re-name
them then you can upgrade without fear of overwriting them. Be sure to
change the line that begins with "@progname" so that your renamed
report will show with its new name on the menu when you choose from the
pick list to run a new report.</p>

<p>A more comprehensive and flexible option is to specify more than one directory in LLPROGRAMS in the Configuration File:</p>

<p>%llroot%:=/home/username/ll</p>

<p>LLPROGRAMS:=%llroot%/Programs:/usr/local/share/lifelines</p>

<p>Thus, /usr/local/share/lifelines has the report scripts from the
LifeLines distribution; ~/ll/Programs has those that I write (or
modify); mine are searched first. &nbsp;That is the usual intended use
of a "directory path."</p>

<p>The only time I update /usr/local/share/lifelines is when I install a new revision level of LifeLines.</p>

<p>Note for Windows users: This method works and the above
Configuration File variables would look like the information below.
Observe the semi-colon (;) used to separate multiple directories in the
LLPROGRAMS setting. NOTE: The default installation name of the reports
directory is "Programs". </p>

<p>%llroot%:=C:\LifeLines</p>

<p>LLPROGRAMS:=%llroot%\Reports;%llroot%\Programs</p>

</p><h2><a name="A84">84. How do I convert PostScript (ps) files to PDF on Windows?</a></h2>
<p>Many of the reports, such as famtree.ll, and ps-anc.ll, or
ps-circle.ll export in PostScript format. These are attractive reports
and suitable for quality printing.</p>

<p>To work with Postscript data, you will need to download the free GhostScript program, <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">http://www.ghostscript.com/</a>. This allows you to print and/or convert Postscript files to PDF, that can be viewed in the Adobe Reader program,<br>

</p><h2><a name="A85">85. How do I convert NROFF files to text on Windows?</a></h2>
<p>NROFF is a general purpose batch mode text formatting tool that is
also used to format man pages on Unix-like operating systems. </p>

<p>See the Sourceforge Project at: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>This project has command line tools for Windows ported from Unix. For groff this is the best option.</p>

<p>To convert a basic groff report from LifeLines to PostScript use this:</p>

<p>groff -mm -Tps ^%outputdir%test &gt;^%outputdir%testCLIP.ps</p>

<p>If you have a table to generate and want PostScript output, use this:<br>
tbl report | groff -me&gt;report.ps</p>

<p>Most of the reports that output in NROFF format also have an RTF
version To work with NROFF data, you will need the Perl script man2html as well as Perl itself.</p>

<p>Another option is to install Cygwin, <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>, which has an NROFF utility.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A86">86. How do I process LaTeX files on Windows?</a></h2>
<p>LaTeX/TeX, pronounced "tek", is a text file with specialized markup
language for printed documents. Some of the reports that export to
LaTeX/TeX format, do not have any other options at this time. To work
with TeX and LaTeX format you will need to download TeX, <a href="http://www.miktex.org/">http://www.miktex.org/</a>.
A minimal installation is about 25 MB, a large installation is 64 MB.
and a full installation is 250 MB. A NoteTab library for ease of
working with MikTeX is available here:<br>
<a href="http://texlips.hypermart.net/index.html">http://texlips.hypermart.net/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>There is a stand-alone LaTeX/TeX to RTF converter:<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/" &gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf=""></a></p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/" &gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf="">Please
note that any LaTeX/TeX conversion still requires some knowledge of
LaTeX and editing of the file to get the desired end results.</a></p>

</p><h2><a name="A87">87. I use a Unix-like system, how do I convert Postscript (ps) files to PDF?</a></h2>
<p>To convert a Postscript file to a PDF file, issue the following command:</p>

<p>ps2pdf filename.ps</p>

<p>This will create a file called "filename.pdf".</p>

<p>NOTE: If you install Ghostscript on Windows the same command will work.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A88">88. I use a Unix-like system, how do I convert nroff files to Postscript (ps) and/or PDF?</a></h2>
<p>To convert an NROFF format file to Postscript or PDF use the following options:</p>

<p>The following processes an nroff file and sends it to a Postscript
file. A second command is required to convert the resulting Postscript
file to PDF.</p>

<p>tbl famrepme.txt | groff -me &gt; test.ps</p>

<p>The following processes an nroff file and sends it to a PDF file. This does it in one command.</p>

<p>tbl famrepme.txt | groff -me &gt; test.pdf</p>

<p>NOTE: If you install Cygwin on Windows, a similar command will work.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A89">89. I use a Unix-like system, how do I convert TeX files to DVI or Postscript (ps) and/or PDF?</a></h2>
<p>1.) Tex to DVI<br>
tex myfamgroup.tex</p>

<p>ALSO:<br>
latex Book.tex (ENTER/R/ENTER) NOTE: This works best.</p>

<p>2.) DVI File to PS<br>
dvips -f myfamgroup.dvi -o myfamgroup.ps Note: This works best.</p>

<p>3.) TeX to PDF<br>
pdftex myfamgroup.tex</p>

<p>NOTE: Similar commands should work on Windows, but LaTeX is required.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A90">90. Is there a way to do graphs in reports?</a></h2>
<p>There are several choices. </p>

<p>PostScript, such as in the ps*.ll reports, i.e. ps-circle. There is
some pre-ready PostScript code for use in LifeLines reports, in some of
the reports. (Should this be in a "stub" file for easier access?)</p>

</p><h2><a name="A91">91. Will the Windows version of LifeLines work on Unix-like systems with wine?</a></h2>
<p>Yes, the Windows version of LifeLines can be installed on Unix-like systems with wine.</p>

<p>Since LifeLines is a console mode program, the command to start it
is not "wine C:\LifeLines\lines.exe", but "wineconsole Lines.exe
Databases/databasename".</p>

<p>A bash script to launch it would look something like this:</p>

<p>#!/bin/bash<br>
cd /home/username/.wine/drive_c/lifelines/<br>
wineconsole Lines.exe Databases/databasename</p>

<p>NOTE: The Windows version of LifeLines on Linux has about the same
performance as the Windows version on Windows. The Linux version is
much faster than the Windows version. Using the Windows version of
LifeLines on a Unix-like operating system with wine is best for
supporting Windows users, to better see what they are seeing if you do
not have a Windows PC.</p>

</p><h2><a name="A92">92. How do I use the LifeLines debugger options?</a></h2>
<p>* Report debugging</p>

<p>There is a built-in report debugger, for the cases when the user is
designing a report, and has made a mistake. It is not very powerful,
but it does allow the user to inspect the local variables at the point
where the report issued an error, to help detect, for example, when a
variable has an unexpected value.</p>

<p>(Obviously this answer could use a nice sample to go with it.)</p>

<p>* LifeLines executable debugging</p>

<p>LifeLines itself is written in C, and can be debugged using
conventional debuggers, such as gdb (the GNU debugger) when compiled
with gcc (the GNU compiler). It traps signals and should offer to dump
core if a failing signal is caught. There is also a commandline
argument (-d) to make it not trap signals, for the purposes of running
it under a debugger, when the signal trapping gets in the way of
debugging.</p>
