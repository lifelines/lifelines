INTRODUCTION

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> is a genealogy program
     that runs on <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym> systems. It maintains
     genealogical records (persons, families, sources, events and
     others) in a database, and generates reports from those
     records. There are no practical limits on the number of
     records that can be stored in a
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database, nor on the
     amounts or kinds of data that can be kept in the
     records. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> does not contain
     built-in reports.  Instead it provides a programming subsystem
     that you use to program your own reports and charts (which has a
	 separate manual -- the lifelines report manual). The
     programming subsystem also lets you query your databases and
     process your data in any
     way. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> uses the terminal
     independent features of <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym> to provide a
     screen and menu based user interface.

</p><p>

     The database is created by entering data with 
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span>.  
     Data can also be imported from <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> 
     files or exported to <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> files.

</p><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> is a non-commercial,
     experimental system that is use at your own risk software. I
     developed <span class="application">LifeLines</span> for personal
     use and shared it with friends. Enough of a demand arose
     through word of mouth and internet, that I have made the
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> source code and other
     information freely available under an MIT-style license
     reproduced below:

INSTALLATION
</h2></div></div></div><p>
You may be installing <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
from a source distribution package or as an executable program
already prepared for your <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym>
or <acronym class="acronym">MS-Windows</acronym> system. The
source distribution comes with the readme, build script and
make files necessary to build
<span class="application">LifeLines</span>. Follow the instructions
in the readme file.  A number of executables are built
which can be put it in a
directory in your execution path. If you get the program in
executable form, follow whatever instructions came with it.
The following executables are included:
</p><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="command"><strong>btedit</strong></span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
a low-level editor for advanced debugging of broken <span class="application">LifeLines</span> databases.
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="command"><strong>dbverify</strong></span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
a utility program to verify <span class="application">LifeLines</span> databases.
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="command"><strong>llexec</strong></span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
a stripped down version of the

the <span class="application">LifeLines</span> program with full user interface
</p></dd></dl></div><p>
The source distribution package also contains documentation
and some <span class="application">LifeLines</span> programs to demonstrate
the capabilities of the report language.
Included with these in the reports directory is a brief overview
of the reports in the file index.html.

STARTING <span class="application">LIFELINES</span> AND CREATING DATABASES

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     You normally start <span class="application">LifeLines</span> with
     the command: <strong class="userinput"><code><span class="command"><strong>llines</strong></span> <em class="replaceable"><code>database</code></em></code></strong> where
     database is the name of a <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     database. If <span class="application">LifeLines</span> finds the
     database, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> opens the
     database and takes you to the program's main menu. If the
     database doesn't exist, <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     asks whether it should create it, and if you answer yes, does
     so. You may create any number of databases, but only one can
     be accessed by <span class="application">LifeLines</span> at a
     time. 

</p><p>

     The full command line interface to
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> is:

     </p><pre class="synopsis">
        <span class="command"><strong>llines</strong></span> <code class="option">[-acdfiklnortuwxzCFI]</code><em class="replaceable"><code>[database]</code></em>
     </pre><p>

</p><p>

     The following options are supported:

</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col width="0.5in" /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>-C</td><td>Specify configuration file location (e.g.
-C/home/bill/lifelines/.linesrc2 ) see the section on System and User Properties below</td></tr><tr><td>-F</td><td>Finnish option (only available if so compiled)
</td></tr><tr><td>-I</td><td>
Specify a user property (e.g. -ILLEDITOR=gvim)
</td></tr><tr><td>-a</td><td>log dynamic memory operation (for debugging)</td></tr><tr><td>-c</td><td>supply cache values (eg, -ci400,4000f400,4000 sets direct indi &amp; fam
caches to 400, and indirect indi &amp; fam caches to 4000)
</td></tr><tr><td>-d</td><td>
debug mode (signal protection disabled for convenience with breakpoints)
</td></tr><tr><td>-f</td><td>
force open the database - use only in emergency
</td></tr><tr><td>-i</td><td>
open database with immutable access (no protection against other
access -- for use on read-only media)
</td></tr><tr><td>-k</td><td>
always show keys (normally keys are suppressed if REFN available)
</td></tr><tr><td>-l</td><td>
lock (-ly) or unlock (-ln) a database for use with read only media
(access to a locked database is treated as immutable)
</td></tr><tr><td>-n</td><td>
do not use traditional family rules
</td></tr><tr><td>-o</td><td>
Specify program output filename (eg, -o/tmp/mytests)
</td></tr><tr><td>-r</td><td>
open database with read-only access (protect against other
writer access)
</td></tr><tr><td>-t</td><td>
trace function calls in report programs (for debugging)
</td></tr><tr><td>-u</td><td>
specify window size (eg, -u120,34 specifies 120 columns by 34 rows)
</td></tr><tr><td>-w</td><td>
open database with writable access (protect against other
writer or reader access)
</td></tr><tr><td>-x</td><td>
execute a single lifelines report program directly
</td></tr><tr><td>-z</td><td>
Use normal ASCII characters for drawing lines in user interface rather
than the vt100 special characters.
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
the <code class="option">-o</code> option specifies the initial filename to use for
output when running reports.  It only applies to reports run with the 
<code class="option">-x</code> option.  This option has no effect on interactively run
programs.
</p><p>

     The <code class="option">-r</code> option opens the database with read-only
     access. When in this mode
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will not let you modify
     the database; no other operations are affected. The
     <code class="option">-w</code> option opens the database with writable
     access. If the database cannot be opened with the requested
     mode <span class="application">LifeLines</span> quits
     immediately. When you open a database with neither the
     <code class="option">-r</code> or <code class="option">-w</code> options,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> first tries to open the
     database with writable access; if not possible
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> then tries to open the
     database with read-only access; and if this is not possible
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> quits. A
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database may be open
     simultaneously by any number of programs with read-only
     access; however, if a database is open by a program with
     writable access, then it cannot be opened by any other other
     program.

</p><p>

     In rare situations the read/write mode mechanism can fail;
     when this happens a database may appear unopenable. If this
     happens use the <code class="option">-f</code> option to force open the
     database; this will open the database and reset the mode
     mechanism. This is a dangerous feature; you can use it to open
     the same database with writable access more than once; the
     results are unpredictable and generally disastrous.

</p><p>

     The multiuser protection supplied by this reader/writer access
     mechanism is provided via a flag setting in the database, so both
     read-only and writable access actually alter the database (read-only
     access only alters the value of this flag). For truly read-only
     access, e.g., for use with read-only media, the best solution is to
     lock (-ly) the      database before copying it to the read-only media. This
     annotates the database itself as being for immutable access.
     Alternatively, to use a database already on read-only media and not
     so annotated, use the immutable (-i) flag.

</p><p>
By default lifelines supports a traditional family concept, that is, each
family has at most one father and one mother.  The -n flag relaxes this
restriction.  However, not all the code in lifelines supports these
relaxations.  For example, the default family browse screen will only display
two parents, however by switching to one of the gedcom modes of displaying the
family you can see all the data.
</p><p>

     If you don't give the name of a database on the command line,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will prompt you for
     it.  If the name you supply is an absolute pathname or a
     relative pathname it is used as the path to the database.
     If you provided a simple filename and you use the
     <code class="envar">LLDATABASES</code> variable or user options (described later),
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will search for the
     database in the directories named in the variable; this can be
     very convenient.
     If <code class="envar">LLDATABASES</code> is not set
     the filename you enter is looked for in the current working directory.

</p><p>

     If you would like to choose a database from a list of existing ones,
     enter a single question mark and press return when
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> prompts you for the database name.
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will then display a list of all
     databases that it can find, and you may select one from the list.

INTRODUCTION TO <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym>

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> records are stored in
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> format; you organize, edit and
     maintain your data in this format. <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym>
     is a standard that defines a file format for moving
     genealogical data between computer systems. 
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> has adopted this
     format for structuring the records in its databases. This
     approach provides a structured yet flexible method for storing
     all the data you wish to record. There are few restrictions on
     the format, amount or type of information you may store in a
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database.

</p><p>

     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> is defined at two levels. At the
     syntactic level <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> is a simple set of
     rules for organizing and structuring data into records, with
     no concern about the types of records, types or formats of
     information in the records, or the relationships between
     records. At the semantic level <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> adds
     an additional set of rules that specify what record types are
     allowed, how records must be structured, how data within the
     records must be identified and formatted, and what specific
     relationships between the record types are allowed. In
     principle there can be multiple semantic versions of
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym>, though in practice there is only
     one, lineage-linked <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym>. Unfortunately
     this semantic version of <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> is poorly
     defined, and every genealogical system has interpreted it in
     different ways.

</p><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> uses
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> primarily at the syntactic level,
     though it does impose a few of the generally accepted
     lineage-linked semantic restrictions. This means some
     important things. It means that you can store all your
     genealogical data in your <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     database, and that you have wide freedom in how you choose
     your own conventions for structuring and formatting your
     data. But it also means that the way you store data in your
     databases can be different from the way that someone else
     stores their data.  This can be a problem if you share data
     with others or share report programs with other
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> users. It is recommended
     to use <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> lineage-linking
     conventions wherever possible.
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> allows you to export
     it's database to a <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> file for
     archival purposes or to exchange data with others.  You can
     also import data from <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> files into
     a <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database. (See Miscellaneous
     Utilities for details.)

</p><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> does not use forms or
     screens to guide you through entering or changing
     data. Instead you use a screen editor and directly edit the
     data records. This requires you to understand the
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> format, and be able to edit data in
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> format, before you can use
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span>. The
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> format is quite simple; this
     introduction will provide all you need to know about
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> in order to use
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span>.

</p><p>

     Here is an example <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> person record:

</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

     A <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> record is made up of lines. Each
     line has a level number and a tag, and most lines have a value
     following the tag. The first line in every record has a
     cross-reference index between the level number and the tag.

</p><p>

     Level numbers allow data to be structured to any degree of
     detail; lines with higher level numbers expand on lines with
     lower numbers. Each record begins at level 0, and each deeper
     level increments the level by
     one. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> does not restrict
     the structuring depth. Tags are uppercase (by convention) code
     words that specify the kind of information on the line or on
     the higher numbered lines that follow. The information after
     the tag, if any, is the value of the line.

</p><p>

     The first line in a record indicates its type. There are four
     fixed record types in <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     databases: person, family, source and event. The first, 0
     level line in these records have tags
     <span class="structname">INDI</span>, <span class="structname">FAM</span>,
     <span class="structname">SOUR</span> and
     <span class="structname">EVEN</span>, respectively. Besides these
     record types, you may create your own record types by using
     any other tag on the 0 level line of a record. The lines that
     begin records are the only level 0 lines used in
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span>. Each level 0 line has a
     cross-reference index between the level number and the
     tag. This index is the record's internal reference key; other
     records may refer to this record by using this index.
     Cross-reference indexes are bracketed by @ characters.

</p><p>

     The first line in the example record has the
     <span class="structname">INDI</span> tag, identifying it as a
     person. The cross-reference index value, I25, can be used by
     other records to refer to this record.

</p><p>

     The second line in the example has the person's name. Each
     person record in a <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     database must have at least one <em class="structfield"><code>1
     NAME</code></em> line, and its value must be in
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> name format. This format allows
     names to be as long as needed, but the surname, which may be
     placed anywhere in the name, must be separated from the rest
     of the name by one or two slashes. For example:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729700816"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.2. 
Example of NAME formats

</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>John/Smith</code></strong>
1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>John /Smith/</code></strong>
1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>John/Smith/Jr.</code></strong>
</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

     The second slash is required only if name elements follow the
     surname. White space is optional before the first slash and
     after the second. If you don't know a person's surname, or the
     person doesn't have a surname, you may use / or // or no
     slashes at all. For example:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729696848"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.3. 
Example of searching on NAMEs
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>Mary//</code></strong>
1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>Mary/</code></strong>
1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>Mary</code></strong>
</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

     are all ways to enter a person named Mary with no known
     surname. A person may have any number, including zero, given
     names and/or initials. A <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     person record may have any number of <em class="structfield"><code>1
     NAME</code></em> lines, though the person will be displayed
     with the first name value only. Persons are indexed under all
     their names, however, so you will be able to search for
     persons by any of their names.
</p><p>

     The next line in the example gives the person's
     sex. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> doesn't require a
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 SEX</code></em> line, but you should include
     it. The value of the line should be <strong class="userinput"><code>M</code></strong>
     or <strong class="userinput"><code>F</code></strong> if the sex is known; it can be
     left blank or set to <strong class="userinput"><code>U</code></strong> or
     <strong class="userinput"><code>?</code></strong>, say, if not known. A person must
     have a <em class="structfield"><code>1 SEX</code></em> line with a value of
     either <strong class="userinput"><code>M</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>F</code></strong>
     before he or she can be made a spouse or parent in a family.

</p><p>

     The example record also contains three events: birth,
     naturalization, and death. An event begins with a level 1 line
     whose tag indicates the event type. For example,
     <em class="structfield"><code>BIRT</code></em> is the tag for a birth event.

</p><p>

     Events usually have at least a <em class="structfield"><code>2
     DATE</code></em> and a <em class="structfield"><code>2 PLAC</code></em>
     line and often a <em class="structfield"><code>2 SOUR</code></em> line. The
     <em class="structfield"><code>DATE</code></em> and
     <em class="structfield"><code>PLAC</code></em> lines give the date and place
     of the event. The value of a
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     <em class="structfield"><code>DATE</code></em> line is free format, though
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will try to parse it for
     specific day, month and year information. The value of a
     <em class="structfield"><code>PLAC</code></em> line is usually a
     comma-separated list of geopolitical units, starting with the
     most specific, ending with the most general. The
     <em class="structfield"><code>SOUR</code></em> line indicates the source of
     information about the event. The
     <em class="structfield"><code>SOUR</code></em> line can be the root of a full
     description of the source, or the value of the
     <em class="structfield"><code>SOUR</code></em> line can be a cross-reference
     key that refers to the source record that describes the
     source.

</p><p>

     The naturalization event (with tag
     <em class="structfield"><code>NATU</code></em>) shows a few other lines. The
     <em class="structfield"><code>2 NAME</code></em> line gives the person's name
     as recorded in the source (only <em class="structfield"><code>1
     NAME</code></em> lines must follow <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym>
     format). The <em class="structfield"><code>2 AGE</code></em> line gives the
     person's age at the time of the event. The <em class="structfield"><code>2
     COUR</code></em> line indicates the court where
     naturalization occurred.

</p><p>

     The final event is a death event (tag
     <em class="structfield"><code>DEAT</code></em>). The <em class="structfield"><code>2
     CAUS</code></em> line gives the cause of death.

</p><p>

     At the end of the record are three lines that refer to family
     records. A <em class="structfield"><code>1 FAMC</code></em> line refers to a
     family record that the person belongs to as a child; its value
     is the cross-reference index value of that family.  A
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 FAMS</code></em> line refers to a family
     record that the person belongs to as a spouse or parent.

</p><p>

     When using <span class="application">LifeLines</span> to edit a
     person, you will not be able to edit the cross reference
     values on the <em class="structfield"><code>0 INDI</code></em>,
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 FAMC</code></em> or <em class="structfield"><code>1
     FAMS</code></em> lines; these are maintained by
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span>.

</p><p>

     Here is an example family record:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729670560"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.4. 
Example family record
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

  0 @F6@ FAM
  1 HUSB @I25@
  1 WIFE @I26@
  1 MARR
    2 DATE <strong class="userinput"><code>31 March 1891</code></strong>
    2 PLAC <strong class="userinput"><code>New London, New London, Connecticut</code></strong>
    2 SOUR <strong class="userinput"><code>New London Vital Records</code></strong>
  1 CHIL @I27@
  1 CHIL @I17@</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

     The <em class="structfield"><code>0 FAM</code></em> line assigns the family
     the cross-reference index of F6. The record contains
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 HUSB</code></em> and <em class="structfield"><code>1
     WIFE</code></em> lines that refer to the two
     spouses/parents. The record also holds a marriage event (tag
     <em class="structfield"><code>MARR</code></em>) and two <em class="structfield"><code>1
     CHIL</code></em> lines that refer to two children in the
     family. When editing family records, you cannot edit the
     <em class="structfield"><code>0 FAM</code></em>, <em class="structfield"><code>1
     HUSB</code></em>, <em class="structfield"><code>1 WIFE</code></em>, or
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 CHIL</code></em> lines; these are maintained
     by <span class="application">LifeLines</span>.

</p><p>

     When you create new records for your database, you are free to
     invent tags and structure your data in any way you see
     fit. However, it is good practice to use standard
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> tags and value formats.
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> does enforce a small set
     of conventions that you must obey. Within person records,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> requires that you use
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 NAME</code></em> and <em class="structfield"><code>1
     SEX</code></em> lines with their special meanings and value
     formats. Though not required,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> assumes that you will use
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 BIRT</code></em>, <em class="structfield"><code>1
     DEAT</code></em>, <em class="structfield"><code>1 CHR</code></em>, and
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 BURI</code></em> lines for birth, death,
     baptism and burial events, respectively. In family records,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> assumes you will use the
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 MARR</code></em> event for marriage
     events. Within person records, you are not allowed to use
     <em class="structfield"><code>0 INDI</code></em>, <em class="structfield"><code>1
     FAMC</code></em> or <em class="structfield"><code>1 FAMS</code></em> lines,
     since these are used to maintain linkage information. Within
     family records, you are not allowed to use <em class="structfield"><code>0
     FAM</code></em>, <em class="structfield"><code>1 HUSB</code></em>,
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 WIFE</code></em> or <em class="structfield"><code>1
     CHIL</code></em> lines.

</p><p>

     The indentation shown in the examples is not part of
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> format. When
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> prepares records for you
     to edit, however, it always indents the records, making them
     easier to read and understand. You do not need to follow this
     indentation scheme when you edit the records. Indentation is
     removed from the data before it is stored in the database.

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729651072"></a>

MAIN MENU

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     After <span class="application">LifeLines</span> opens an existing
     database, or creates a new one, it presents you with the main
     menu:

</p><pre class="screen">
Please choose an operation:
   b Browse the persons in the database
   s Search database
   a Add information to the database
   d Delete information from the database
   p Pick a report from list and run
   r Generate report by entering report name
   t Modify character translation tables
   u Miscellaneous utilities
   x Handle source, event and other records
   Q Quit current database
   q Quit program
</pre><p>


</p><p>

     Select an operation by striking the proper selection letter.

</p><p>

     The browse operation lets you browse the database and perform
     many operations on the data. The search operation provides some
     simple wildcard search capabilities, which lead into browsing
     particular records. The add operation lets you add
     new information, and the delete operation removes
     information. The report operations read report
     programs and generates output reports. The modify character
     translation tables operation changes the translation
     tables. The miscellaneous utilities operation provides such
     things as backup and restore. The handle source, event and
     other records operation gives you access to these three record
     types. The quit operation closes the database and returns to
     <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym>.

</p><p>

     The browse operation deserves special mention, because it
     provides a rich environment for searching, viewing, adding,
     modifying, merging and deleting information in the
     database. You will find that you operate from the browsing
     modes most of the time. The operations are all described in
     later sections.

CODESET

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     After you have created a new database, and before you actually
     add any data to it, is the time to set the codeset to be used
     in the database.

</p><p>

     The codeset (or character encoding, to use precise Unicode
     terminology) is the decision as to how letters will be represented
     by the computer. If you have only ever used English letters in
     computing, you may not have had to encounter this issue, because as
     it happens, the English letters (a-z and A-Z) are stored numerically
     in the same fashion in almost all codesets used by computers. However,
     in the field of genealogy, you are especially likely to meet letters
     outside of the English alphabet (for example, accented vowels).

</p><p>

     You have fundamentally three choices as to what codeset to use in your
     database, listed below from easiest to most powerful.

</p><p>

     First, you may leave it entirely unspecified. This will give the 
     traditional lifelines behavior. This is really only suitable if either
     (a), you only use English (ASCII) data, or (b), you work in an 
     environment which entirely uses the same 8-bit codeset (eg, a GNU/Linux box
     which is all ISO-8859-15), and you only run lifelines in English.
     If you use any non-English data on MS-Windows, this is not likely to 
     be suitable, because the lifelines screens run in the console, but 
     you are likely to use MS-Windows applications either for editing or 
     for viewing output, and the MS-Windows console uses a different 
     codeset from MS-Windows applications. Also, if you use lifelines in a
     different language than English, this may not be suitable, because 
     the gettext message catalogs (for non-English interface) will not 
     be converted into your codeset.

</p><p>

     Second, you may specify a particular 8-bit codeset. Assuming that you
     have iconv and gettext installed (or you are using the MS-Windows version,
     which comes with these), you may specify any 8-bit codeset supported by
     iconv, and iconv supports quite many. A natural choice for Western European
     languages would be ISO-8859-1, or (for MS-Windows only) CP-1252. With this
     option, gettext language files will be converted to your codeset.

</p><p>

     Third, you may specify the use of UTF-8. This is a Unicode encoding, and
     is by far the most powerful option. In fact, this is the only really
     convenient way to be able to store, for example, names in English, names
     in Russian, and names in Greek, all in the same database, in their native
     scripts (alphabets).  In recent versions, lifelines has become more
     knowledgeable about handling UTF-8, so that, for example, upper &amp;
     lower casing only work correctly with versions from 3.0.28 on.

</p><p>

     To actually specify a codeset, enter it via the u(tility) o(ptions) page
     (which is documented below). From the main menu, in the English version,
     press u to reach the utility page, and then o to edit the user options. To
     set a codeset of, e.g., ISO-8859-1, enter this string on its own line,
     without the surrounding quotes: "codeset=ISO-8859-1". Or, to specify the
     use of UTF-8, "codeset=UTF-8".

ENTERING THE FIRST PERSON

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     Note: Before you add the first person to your database, you
     specify internal codeset (review the Codeset chapter for
     information).

</p><p>

     Normally you add persons to the database from the browsing
     modes, but when entering the first person there is no one in
     the database to browse to. To add the first person to a
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database, first select
     the add operation from the main menu. You will be prompted
     with the add menu (described later).  Strike p to add a
     person. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> creates a
     template of a <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> person record, and
     puts you in a screen editor to edit the template. The default
     template is:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729632800"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.5. 
Default person record template
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

  0 INDI
  1 NAME <em class="replaceable"><code>Fname /Surname/</code></em>
  1 SEX <em class="replaceable"><code>MF</code></em>
  1 BIRT
    2 DATE
    2 PLAC
    2 SOUR
  1 DEAT
    2 DATE
    2 PLAC
    2 SOUR</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

     Edit the template to create the new person's record. Change
     the name to the person's name. Assign the person's sex by
     deleting either <strong class="userinput"><code>M</code></strong> or
     <strong class="userinput"><code>F</code></strong>. Fill out the birth and death events
     as best you can. If the person is alive, remove the death
     event. Remove any <em class="structfield"><code>DATE</code></em> and
     <em class="structfield"><code>PLAC</code></em> lines you do not have the
     information for.

</p><p>

     The default template provides lines for one birth and one
     death event. You can expand the record with other events (even
     more birth or death events) and lines. Indentation makes it
     easier to read and edit the record, but isn't necessary. You
     may change the default edit template by defining the user
     option <code class="option">INDIREC</code> (described later).

</p><p>

     Here is how I might edit the template when creating a record
     about myself:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729626352"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.6. 
Example editing of template record
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

... lots of other events and facts
</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

     When you edit a person record, don't add or modify
     <em class="structfield"><code>INDI</code></em>,
     <em class="structfield"><code>FAMC</code></em> or
     <em class="structfield"><code>FAMS</code></em>
     lines. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> creates and
     maintains these lines through specific user commands.

</p><p>

     When you finish editing and leave the editor, you
     automatically return to
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span>. If you made an error
     (eg, didn't use proper level numbers or didn't follow the
     proper name convention), <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     displays an error message, and asks if you want to re-edit the
     record. If you don't, <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     doesn't add the person to the database.

</p><p>

     When the record is in proper format,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> asks if you are sure you
     want to add the person to the database. If you answer yes, the
     person is added; if you answer no, the person isn't. In both
     cases <span class="application">LifeLines</span> returns to the main
     menu.

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729612320"></a>

SCREEN EDITORS AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     With <span class="application">LifeLines</span> you maintain the
     database records using a screen editor. This is different than
     other genealogical programs where screens or forms are used to
     gather the data.The default screen editor for
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> is
     <span class="application">vi</span>. (The <acronym class="acronym">MS-Windows</acronym>
     version defaults instead to notepad.exe.) This can be overridden by the
     <code class="envar">ED</code>, <code class="envar">EDITOR</code> or
     <code class="envar">LLEDITOR</code> environment variables. For example, if
     you prefer the emacs screen editor, and if you use a bourne-compatible
     shell, you may add the line:
     <strong class="userinput"><code><code class="envar">ED</code>=<em class="replaceable"><code>emacs</code></em></code></strong>
     to your login profile file, and
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will use
     <span class="application">emacs</span> for editing.

</p><p>

     There are four other, <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     specific environment variables. They are
     <code class="envar">LLDATABASES</code>, <code class="envar">LLARCHIVES</code>,
     <code class="envar">LLPROGRAMS</code> and <code class="envar">LLREPORTS</code>.
     <code class="envar">LLDATABASES</code> and
     <code class="envar">LLPROGRAMS</code> are <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym> path
     list variables.  

</p><p>
     There is also a configuration file, and
     entries in it may be used in lieu of environment variables.
     It is ordinarily named .linesrc under <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym>,
     and lines.cfg under <acronym class="acronym">MS-Windows</acronym>.
     A sample configuration file should have been included
     in the distribution.
</p><p>
     See the section on System and User properties
     for more details.
</p><p>

     <code class="envar">LLDATABASES</code> can be set to a list of directories
     that hold <span class="application">LifeLines</span> databases. When
     you execute the <span class="application">LifeLines</span> program,
     these directories will be searched in turn for the database
     mentioned on the command line. For example,
     <strong class="userinput"><code><code class="envar">LLDATABASES</code>=<em class="replaceable"><code>.:/home/ttw4/LifeLines/Databases</code></em></code></strong>
     indicates that databases should be searched for in the current
     directory first, and if not found there, then searched for in:
     <code class="filename">/home/ttw4/LifeLines/Databases</code>

</p><p>

     Each <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database is
     implemented as a directory with specific contents. The
     <code class="envar">LLDATABASES</code> variable should be set to a list of
     directories that contain these database directories, not to a
     list of database directories themselves.

</p><p>

     The environment variable <code class="envar">LLPROGRAMS</code> is used in
     the same way, but to specify the search path for
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> report generating and
     other programs (described later).

</p><p>

     <code class="envar">LLARCHIVES</code> and <code class="envar">LLREPORTS</code> can
     each be set to specify a single
     directory. <code class="envar">LLARCHIVES</code> is used to select a
     directory where all database backup files will be stored, and
     <code class="envar">LLREPORTS</code> is used to select a directory where
     all generated reports and program outputs will be placed.

</p><p>

     New databases without explicit paths will be created in the
     first directory listed in the LLDATABASES path. (This is a 
     change; versions from 3.0.6 to 3.0.31 used a now obsolete
     variable LLNEWDBDIR).

</p><p>

     You are not required to use these environment variables; when
     a variable is not defined,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> uses the current
     directory as its default value. If you do use the variables,
     you can override their use by specifying files and directories
     as either absolute or relative paths.

</p><p>

     You may use the configuration file in
     lieu of environment variables. This is especially oriented towards
     users on <acronym class="acronym">MS-Windows</acronym> systems, on which
     environment variables are not as common a configuration technique.

</p><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> uses the curses library
     for terminal independent I/O. This requires you to specify
     your terminal type with the <code class="envar">TERM</code> environment
     variable. (This is not relevant in the <acronym class="acronym">MS-Windows</acronym>
     version.)

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729584784"></a>

BASICS OF BROWSING

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     You will use the browsing screens of
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> most of the time. When in
     these modes you can quickly search for or browse through the
     persons and families in the database. When you find a person
     or family you are interested in, you can then edit their
     records.

</p><p>
     The browsing screens also allow you to add new persons and
     families to the database, add spouses to families, add
     children to families, swap the order of spouses and children,
     merge persons and merge families, and perform other
     operations. The browsing screens also lets you remove spouses
     from families and remove children from families.
</p><p>
     There are six browsing screens. The person and family screens
     concentrate on a single person and family, respectively. The
     list screen allows you to browse through a list of persons. The
     two person browse screen shows two persons at once, and the
     two family browse screen shows two families at once. The
     auxiliary screen is used browsing any other type of records
     (e.g., events, sources, notes).

</p><p>
     Each browsing screen has multiple
     view modes. The view mode affects how the information is displayed
     on the screen, but does not affect the menu choices available at
     the bottom of the screen. Menu commands are available on each screen
     to change amongst the view modes available for that screen.
</p><p>
     The person screen has the most view modes. It has normal mode,
     which shows a summary of the vital records of the person. It (like
     all other screens) has GEDCOM mode, which shows the actual GEDCOM
     data of the record, and also expanded GEDCOM mode, which shows the
     actual GEDCOM data, but augments it with information on each line
     that contains a cross-reference (GEDCOM xref). It has two pedigree
     or tree modes, one showing an ancestral tree and one showing a
     descendant tree. The depth of the pedigree trees shown may be
     adjusted via menu commands.
</p><p>
     The two person browse screen has the same modes as the person
     screen.
</p><p>
     The two family browse screen and tandem family screen alike have
     normal mode (showing a summary of vitals), GEDCOM mode, and
     expanded GEDCOM mode.
</p><p>
     The auxiliary screen has only GEDCOM mode and expanded GEDCOM mode.
     (The list screen has no view modes at present).
</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729577872"></a>

IDENTIFYING A PERSON OR LIST OF PERSONS TO BROWSE

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     To enter the browsing modes from the main menu strike
     b. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> asks you to identify a
     person or list of persons to browse to:

</p><pre class="screen">
Please identify person or persons to browse to.
Enter name, key, refn or list:
</pre><p>

</p><p>

     Enter either a name or partial name, or an internal key value,
     or a user-defined reference key (described later) or the name
     of a previously defined list of persons (described later), and
     strike return.

</p><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> allows wide flexibility
     in how to enter names. You may enter a name in upper or lower
     case or any combination. You may leave out all but the first
     given name, and, for given names, you may leave out any
     letters except the first. You may leave vowels out of the
     surname, and after four or five consonants have been typed,
     you may leave them out too. You must separate the given names
     from the surname by a slash, and if you enter given names
     after the surname (as in Chinese names), or any modifiers
     (such as Jr, Sr, IV, etc.), they must be separated from the
     surname by another slash. Here are a few of the ways I can
     enter my name:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729573136"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.7. 
Example of entering a name
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><div class="literallayout"><p><br />
Thomas Trask /Wetmore/ IV<br />
thomas/wetmore/iv<br />
t t/wetmr/i<br />
th tr/Wetmore<br />
t/wtmr/iv<br />
</p></div></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

     You may browse to the list of all persons with the same
     surname by using the * character as the first initial. For
     example:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729570864"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.8. 
Example of using wildcard in browsing
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><div class="literallayout"><p>*/wetmore</p></div></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />matches all
     persons with surname Wetmore. This is the only wildcard
     feature supported in browsing. (However, the search operation
     provides some simple wildcards for
     finding individual name fragments, or searching by user-defined
     reference keys. The search operation is accessed via a different
     choice off of the main menu.)

</p><p>

     After you enter a name, <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     searches for all persons who match. There are three
     possibilities: no one matches; one person matches; or more
     than one person matches. In the first case
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> writes: 
     </p><pre class="screen">There is no one in the database with that name or key.</pre><p>
     and leaves you in the main menu.

</p><p>

     If one person matches, <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     enters the person browse mode displaying the matched
     person. If more than one person matches,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> enters the list browsing
     mode with the list of matching persons.

</p><p>

     You may also identify a person by entering his or her
     internal, cross-reference key value. The internal key values
     of all person records are an I followed by digits.
     When you enter a key value you may omit the I.
     If <span class="application">LifeLines</span> finds a person with
     the key value you provide,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> enters the person
     browsing mode displaying that person.  You can also browse to
     a Family, Source, or Note by entering its key, but you must
     include the letter identifing the key type, thus F11, S1, or N3
     would browse to the family, source or note corresponding to the key
     if it exists.

</p><p>

     The browse command b is also available from most browsing
     modes. The command works the same way from those modes as it
     does from the main menu.

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729561568"></a>

ZIP IDENTIFYING A NEW PERSON

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     Some <span class="application">LifeLines</span> operations need you
     to identify a person, not for the purpose of browsing, but for
     the purpose of completing an operation you have requested. For
     example, when you add a child to a family,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> may ask you to identify
     the child. When this happens a panel pops up that asks you to
     identify a person. You respond by typing a name or key exactly
     as you would for the b command. If no one matches,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> returns to the previous
     browsing mode. If the name matches persons in the database
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> displays something like:

</p><pre class="screen">
Please choose from among these records.
  &gt;Thomas Trask Wetmore, b. 1826, N.B. (42)
   Thomas Trask Wetmore IV, b. 1949, Conn. (1)
   Thomas Trask Wetmore III, b. 1925, Conn. (6)
   Thomas Trask Wetmore Jr, b. 1896, Conn. (11)
   Thomas Trask Wetmore Sr, b. 1866, N.S. (23)
   Thomas Trask Wetmore V, b. 1982, Mass. (5)
_______________________________________________
Commands: j Move down k Move up i Select q Quit
</pre><p>


</p><p>

     Use the j and k commands to move the selection cursor (&gt;) to
     the correct person, and then use the i command to select that
     person. There may be more persons in the list than you can see
     at once. If this is so then you can use the j and k commands
     to scroll through the full list. If you don't find the proper
     person, use the q command and
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> asks whether you want to
     enter another name.

</p><p>

     With version 3.0.15, lists may also be navigated with the up
     and down arrows, PageUp and PageDown keys, Home and End keys, and
     the Enter key. Shift-PageUp and Shift-PageDown move more than one
     page at a time in a given direction. The keyboard equivalents are
     j=UpArrow, k=DownArrow, u=PageUp, d=PageDown, ^=Home, $=End,
     U=Shift-PageUp, D=Shift-PageDown, i=Enter.

</p><p>

     When <span class="application">LifeLines</span> creates a list of
     names for you to select from, it tries to add extra
     information to the name; this helps determine which name to
     choose, and is important in databases where many persons have
     the same name. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> also
     places the person's key value at the end of each menu line;
     this may be helpful in large databases.

</p><p>

     Some browse screens provide the z command, which allows you to
     browse to a new person using the zip style of identification
     rather than the b style.

BROWSE DISPLAY BASICS

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     The screen display for each browsing screen is made up of
     panels. At the bottom of each display is a message panel used
     for one line messages. Each display contains one or two data
     panels showing information from the database. And each display
     has a panel with the operation menu available for that screen.

PERSON BROWSE SCREEN

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     After you identify a person to browse to,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> enters the person browse
     screen. The top panel in the display gives basic information
     about the person (in the normal, or vitals, mode, which is the
     default). The middle panel provides a menu of commands.
     For example:

SEARCH MENU
</h2></div></div></div><p>
If you choose Search database from the main menu, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> displays the search menu:
</p><pre class="screen">
How would you like to find a record?
  v Review visit history (12 records)
  c Review change history (3 records)
  f Full database scan
  q Return to previous menu
</pre><p>
The first two items will depend on your previous activity.  If you have
browsed to individuals or family records in the database,
the first item will appear similar to what's shown above,
if you haven't it will just contain a note that the visit history is empty.
The second item will appear similar to what's shown above if you
have changed individual records in this session 
with <span class="application">LifeLines</span>, otherwise it will contain
a note that the change history is empty.
</p><p>
Selecting a non-empty visit history or change history will bring up a list
of individuals (or families) that are in the history, allowing you to
browse to that individual or family. 
</p><p>
If you choose Full database scan off the search menu, 
<span class="application">LifeLines</span> displays the fullscan menu.
</p><pre class="screen">
What scan type?
  f  Full name scan
  n  Name fragment (whitespace-delimited) scan
  r  Refn scan
  q  Return to previous menu
</pre><p>
The first two items on this menu allow you to search all the NAME
records in the current database.
If you choose Full name scan you are prompted for a 
search pattern and then <span class="application">LifeLines</span> searches for all 
the individual NAME records whose value matches the pattern supplied.
If you choose the Name fragment scan, you will be prompted for a 
search pattern and then <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will search for
whitespace delimited words within individual NAME records that match the
pattern supplied.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm139852729280640"></a>
Search Patterns
</h3></div></div></div><p>
The pattern supplied to the search commands is used to match against
the names in the database.  The following characters have special meaning
when used in a pattern:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col width="0.5in" /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>?</td><td>Matches any single character</td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>
Matches zero or more occurrences of any character
</td></tr><tr><td>SUB</td><td>
a control Z (^Z) is similar to '*', this matches zero
or more occurrences of any characters other than '.'.
(of course you probably can't type this on unix)
</td></tr><tr><td>[ab]</td><td>
A set of characters enclosed in square brackets
matches the single characters listed between the
brackets.  If the dash '-' character is to be included,
it must immediately follow the opening bracket '['.
If the closing bracket ']' character is to be included,
it must be preceded by a quote '`'.
</td></tr><tr><td>[a-z]</td><td>
Matches a single character in the range 'a' to 'z'.
Ranges and sets may be combined within the same set of
brackets.
</td></tr><tr><td>!R</td><td>
Matches a single character not in the range 'R'.
If range 'R' includes the dash '-' character, the dash
must immediately follow the '!'.
</td></tr><tr><td>!</td><td>
Makes the following pattern match
any string except those what it would normally match.
</td></tr><tr><td>QUOTE</td><td>
(On DOS this is `, on UNIX it is \)
Makes the next character a regular (nonspecial)
character.
Note that to match the quote character itself, it must
be quoted.
Note that this character must be escaped if used within
string constants ("\\").
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
</p><p>
Upper and lower case alphabetic characters are considered identical,
i.e., 'a' and 'A' match each other.
(What constitutes a lowercase letter depends on the current locale
settings.)
</p><p>
Spaces and control characters (other than control z) are treated as normal 
characters,
</p><p>
As an example, consider the following NAME record:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>John /Smith/</code></strong>
</pre><p>
When doing a full name search, the value searched is the complete gedcom name 
value including the slashes used to delimit the surname.
in order to have a match, the search pattern
must match the slashes.  Thus

</p><pre class="programlisting">
*smith
</pre><p>
will not match this name, whereas
</p><pre class="programlisting">
*smith/
</pre><p>
will match.
</p><p>
When doing a name fragment search, the slashes are removed from the surname
before trying to match the name, thus
</p><pre class="programlisting">
smith
smi*
joh*
*hn
</pre><p>
will all match this NAME record.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729261104"></a>
ADD OPERATION
</h2></div></div></div><p>

If you choose the add operation from the main menu, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> displays the add menu:
</p><pre class="screen">
What do you want to add?
  p Person - add new person to the database
  f Family - create family record from one or two spouses
  c Child - add a child to an existing family
  s Spouse - add a spouse to an existing family
  q Quit - return to the previous menu
</pre><p>


</p><p>

These operations work in a straightforward way. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> asks you the necessary questions, and lets
you cancel at any time. The operations provided by this menu are also available from the browsing
modes, and are often easier to perform there.

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729257216"></a>

DELETE OPERATION

</h2></div></div></div><p>

If you choose the delete operation at the main menu, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> displays the delete menu:
</p><pre class="screen">
What do you want to delete?
  c Child - remove a child from his/her family
  s Spouse - remove a spouse from a family
  p Person - remove a person completely
  q Quit - return to the previous menu
</pre><p>


</p><p>

These operations also work in a straightforward way. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> asks you the necessary questions and
lets you cancel at any time.


</p><p>

You may also remove a child from his/her family, or remove a spouse/parent from his/her family,
from the person browsing mode. In both cases, only a relationship is removed, not a person. On the other
hand, the delete menu must be used if you want to completely remove a person from the database; this
cannot be done from the browsing mode.


</p><p>

There is no special operation for removing a family record. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> silently removes any family
record that has no parent or child associated with it.

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729251584"></a>

CODESET CONVERSION

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     (This section was previously entitled CHARACTER TRANSLATION.)

</p><p>

     The intention is that you need only specify the internal codeset for
     each database you create (and this step may be automated via the NewDbProps
     property), and all else works pretty well without tuning. That is,
     lifelines tries to guess the correct codeset for your environment (including
     guessing the console and windows codesets when operating under MS-Windows,
     which it should do fairly well).

</p><p>

     However, you may encounter situations where you wish to alter the codeset
     behavior, or the codeset conversion is not operating correctly (in which case
     we hope you will report the problem to the mailing list and/or github
     bugs list).

</p><p>

     There are two ways to amend codeset conversion. The first method is by
     changing configuration variables. For example, if you wish to generate an
     HTML report of all your data, which includes names in Russian (in Cyrillic
     letters), for your cousin, and you know that your cousin's computer has no
     font for Cyrillic letters, you might wish to temporarily adjust your
     report output codeset so that you will get interpolated ASCII letters for
     the Russian letters. You could do this by temporarily altering the
     configuration variable ReportCodesetOut to be "ASCII" (actually, if any of
     your data has characters in it that are reserved in HTML, such as the less
     than sign, or the ampersand, you would probably want "ASCII//HTML").

</p><p>

     The second way to change codeset conversion, and the only way in lifelines
     3.0.6, is to edit the embedded character translation tables, in which you
     actually specify the letters you want converted, letter by letter, and how
     you want them converted.  This method, unlike the first, even works in
     databases with no specified internal codeset.  </p><p>

If you choose the modify character translation tables operation from the main menu, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> displays
the character translation menu:
</p><pre class="screen">
Which character mapping do you want to edit?
   e Editor to Internal mapping
   m Internal to Editor mapping
   i GEDCOM to Internal mapping
   x Internal to GEDCOM mapping
   d Internal to Display mapping
   r Internal to Report mapping
   q Return to main menu
</pre><p>


</p><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> can do codeset conversion in changing
     text from one form to another, and lifelines supports five different
     forms.

</p><p>

</p><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt><span class="glossterm">internal</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

for records in the database

</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">editor</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
for records being edited
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">display</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
for records being displayed
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">report</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
for records written to output file
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">GEDCOM</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
for records read in from or written out to GEDCOM
</p></dd></dl></div><p>

     When converting text from one form to another
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> normally uses iconv conversion, and
     codesets specified in configuration variables. This may be augmented by
     codeset translation or extension using the text conversion (*.tt) files in
     the tt subdirectory. To use the tables in the tt subdirectory,
     you need to set
     the property "TTPATH" in your <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
     configuration file to the path of the tt directory.  There are two types
     of files in this directory. 
     
</p><p>
     
     Files of the form &lt;codeset&gt;_&lt;codeset1&gt;.tt convert from one 
     codeset to another. For example, CP1250_UTF-8.tt can be used to convert
     characters in codeset CP1250 to their representations in UTF-8.
     
</p><p>

     Files of the form &lt;codeset&gt;__&lt;subcodeset&gt;.tt apply a
     conversion within the codeset, for example, UTF-8__html.tt is a
     sub-conversion that converts UTF-8 characters that have special escape
     codes within html to those special codes.  For example, specifying the
     report codeset to be UTF-8//html will apply the html sub-conversion to
     all the data being written.  Probably not what you really wanted.
     See the report language function convertcode() in the reportmanual for
     details.

</p><p>
     
     If your system lacks iconv, or you need more specialized
     conversion than provided with iconv, you may either write a text
     conversion file (a tt file), or you may edit one of the in-database
     translation tables.
 
</p><p>

     The in-database translation tables convert between forms (as listed
     above). Every translation table converts either to the internal form, or
     from the internal form. That is, the internal form is used as an
     intermediate step in all operations. There are six supported translation
     tables.  The following table shows the six tables and describes when they
     are applied:

After you select a translation table you are placed in the editor to edit the table. Translation tables are
made up of lines that look like:
</p><pre class="synopsis"><em class="replaceable"><code>pattern</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>pattern</code></em></pre><p>
where a tab separates the patterns. Each pattern is an arbitrary sequence of verbatim <acronym class="acronym">ASCII</acronym> characters
and escape sequences. Translation occurs by finding all occurrences that match left patterns and
replacing them with the corresponding right patterns.

</p><p>
There are five escape mechanisms used in patterns:
</p><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt><span class="glossterm">#nnn</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
nnn is a decimal character value
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">$hh</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
hh is a hexadecimal character value
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">\ #</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
represents the # character
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">\$</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
represents the $ character
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">\\</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
represents the \ character
</p></dd></dl></div><p>

     It is possible, and desirable, to provide a short name for
     the translation table, using the "##!name: " command. An 
     example would be

</p><pre class="programlisting">
##!name: UTF-8 to latex
</pre><p>

     Naming the translation table is desirable because these 
     names are displayed, at least in part and if they fit, on
     the translation table menu.

</p><p>

     It is possible to format the file using a character other than
     tab as the separator between source and destination code. To do
     requires using the "##!sep" command. Those exact six characters
     must begin the line, and then the next character is the new
     separator for all following lines. For clarity, this should only
     occur once, and near the top of the file before any actual
     translation lines, and a fairly clear separator should be used
     (e.g., the equal sign "=").

</p><p>

     Any line which is blank, or which begins with two hash marks (##), is
     ignored. Therefore, comments begin with two hash marks.

</p><p>

     For advanced users, it is possible to mix different types of 
     conversion, for example iconv conversion and also translation
     table conversion, in the same form step. For example, it is possible
     to convert internal database text (internal form) first via the
     "internal to GEDCOM" in-database translation table, and then via
     the iconv conversion from configured internal codeset to configured
     GEDCOM codeset. In-database translation tables are always applied
     in the internal codeset, so when converting to the internal form,
     they are applied after iconv and/or tt conversions, and when
     converting from internal form, they are applied first.

</p><p>

     An example of adding a mixin in-database translation table might
     be to escape certain characters which are control characters
     to an output computer language, e.g., latex. One could create an
     "Internal to Report" mapping in UTF-8 (if the database is internally
     UTF-8) to escape any characters that may occur in place names or
     textual descriptions and inadvertently cause grief in latex
     processing.

</p><p>

     However, in this case, one could also write a tt file to achieve
     the same results, and be shared across databases, by naming it, eg,
     UTF-8__latex.tt. The double underscore ("__") signifies that this
     is a conversion to be applied to text which is in UTF-8, and to 
     trigger Lifelines to use this, one must specify a report codeset
     such as "UTF-8//latex" (if UTF-8 output is desired, but with the
     latex conversion first applied), or "ISO-8859-1//latex" (if 
     ISO-8859-1 output is desired, but with the latex conversion first
     applied).

MISCELLANEOUS UTILITIES

</h2></div></div></div><p>

If you choose the miscellaneous utilities operation,
<span class="application">LifeLines</span> displays the utilities menu:
</p><pre class="screen">
What utility do you want to perform?
  s Save the database in a GEDCOM file

This command saves the complete <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database in a
<acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> file. All person, family, event, source and user-defined records are stored. This command
may be used to periodically back up your database. When you use this command, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> asks you
for the name of the file. If you have defined the <code class="envar">LLARCHIVE</code> shell variable, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will store
the file in the directory named in the variable.

</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>r</strong></span> <span class="action">Read in data from a GEDCOM file.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

This command allows you restore a complete database from a
<acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> file. When you select this command, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> asks you for the name of the <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> file.
This command can also be used to import data from a <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> file to an existing database. When
<span class="application">LifeLines</span> performs this command, it first reads the entire <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> file and checks it for validity.
If there are problems in the file, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> describes them, writing them to the file err.log, and does
not add any records to the database. If there are no problems, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> adds all the records found in
the file to the database (only header and trailer records are not stored in the database).

</p><p>
Normally, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will replace the XREF's (the
identifiers for individuals, families, sources, notes, etc.) in the
<acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> with its own.
These identifiers are reserved by the <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> for internal
use of genealogy programs.  However, if the identifiers are compatible with
<span class="application">LifeLines</span> internal representation and there are no
conflicts with existing identifiers, <span class="application">LifeLines</span> will
ask you if you want to preserve the identifiers in the 
<acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> 
file rather than assign new values.
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>k</strong></span> <span class="action">Find a person's key value.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>e</strong></span> <span class="action">Edit the place abbreviation file.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

     This command allows you to edit the place abbreviations
     file. This file defines the abbreviations that are used by
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> when it creates lists of
     persons for you to select from. Each line in the file has the
     format:</p><pre class="synopsis"><em class="replaceable"><code>word</code></em>:<em class="replaceable"><code>
     abbr </code></em></pre><p>where word is a word to be
     abbreviated, and abbr is its abbreviation. The word and its
     abbreviation are separated by a colon. For example:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729175632"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.9. 
Example of using abbreviations
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><div class="literallayout"><p>Connecticut:Conn.<br />
Massachusetts:Mass.<br />
Nova Scotia:N.S.</p></div></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

When <span class="application">LifeLines</span> constructs lists of persons for you to select from, it looks up the last component of
certain <em class="structfield"><code>PLAC</code></em> lines in this file, and if it finds that component, replaces it with its abbreviation.

</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>o</strong></span>
<span class="action">Edit the user options file.</span>
</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

This command allows you to edit the user options file. The user options file
is a record kept in the database that holds user selectable options. Each
option has a name and a string value. Each line in the options file has the
format:</p><pre class="synopsis"><em class="replaceable"><code>option</code></em>=<em class="replaceable"><code>value</code></em></pre><p>
where option is the name of an option and value is the option's string value.
If the value is more than one line long, then the last character in each
non-final line must be a backslash. The escapes \n and \t are also recognized
in version 3.0.7 and better (to represent a carriage return and a tab, respectively).
These (\n and \t) are primarily for use in custom record templates.
In version 3.0.14 there are 39 options. Note that all of these may also be specified in
the configuration file, to apply to all databases, but if specified in
both places, the entry in the database (user options table) governs.
For more information, see the sample configuration file; each option is preceded
by a brief explanation.

</p><p>
The list of options can be found in the section 'System and User Properties'
below.
</p></dd></dl></div><p>

For example if you would like to replace the default person
record template with the following:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729166880"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.10.

</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

  0 INDI
  1 NAME //
  1 SEX</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />
you would edit the user option file to contain:</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729165536"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.11. 
Example of replaced default person record template
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><div class="literallayout"><p>INDIREC=0 INDI\<br />
  1 NAME //\<br />
  1 SEX</p></div></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

or, using the \n escape so as to keep the entry on one line:</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729163824"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.12. 
Example of replaced single line default person record template

IMPORT ERRORS
</h2></div></div></div><p>
Errors generated during a GEDCOM import are logged to a file,
by default named errs.log. 
</p><p>
A number of errors are related to having an incorrect XREF value.
An XREF is the internal name used to Identify a family, individual, note,
source or other record.  An XREF is bracketed by two @ signs.  As an example
</p><pre class="programlisting">  0 @F6@ FAM
  1 HUSB @I25@
  1 WIFE @I26@
  1 CHIL @I17@</pre><p>
Here F6 is the internal name of this family.  The family refers
to other individuals by specifying their XREF values.  Also I25, I26 and I17
are XREF values of individuals. 
</p><p>
XREF values used within <span class="application">LifeLines</span> are totally under
the control of <span class="application">LifeLines</span>.
The values that are used are always of the form, a single letter, followed by
a number.  However, when importing a gedcom
<span class="application">LifeLines</span> should accept almost
anything as an XREF, converting it to what is needed for internal use.
For the curious, the letters that <span class="application">LifeLines</span> uses
are I for Individual, F for Family, S for Source, E for Events, and X for
other records.

</p><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt><span class="glossterm">Bad NAME syntax.</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

     A level 1 NAME record must have a value, and the value must not be a pointer, and may 
     have no more than two slashes.
</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729151712"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.13.

     The XREF values must be unique.  These error messages are
     generated if a XREF is found to refer to two different records.
     For example, the XREF for a family is the same as one for an individual.

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729147968"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.14.

</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">Person INDI_XYZ is multiply defined: skipped.</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

     No XREF value of an INDI may be reused.  This message indicates that
     INDI_XYZ has been used to identify two different persons.

HANDLING SOURCE, EVENT AND USER-DEFINED RECORDS

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> supports source, event
     and other, user-defined record types.  You can access these
     features in two ways: either through the x operation from the
     main menu, or via commands in the individual and family browse
     screens.  The first approach might be most convenient when you
     are solely working with these record types.  The second makes
     it easier to work with source, event and user-defined records
     in parallel with your person and family records; this can be
     useful for instance when you want to create references from
     your person and family record to your source, event and user
     defined records as you create them, and to view and edit
     records that you have referenced from within a person or
     family record.

</p><p>

     Using the first of these two possibilities
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> displays the following
     menu:

</p><pre class="screen">
What activity do you want to perform?

  s  Browse source records
  e  Browse event records
  x  Browse other records
  1  Add a source record to the database
  2  Edit source record from the database
  3  Add an event record to the database
  4  Edit event record from the database
  5  Add an other record to the database
  6  Edit other record from the database
  q  Return to main menu
</pre><p>

     Using the second variant (from the person and family browse
     screens), the following six commands are available. The first
     three are described alongside with their counterparts in the x
     menu (they do mostly, but not entirely, the same things); the
     last three are described separately:

</p><pre class="screen">
  %s  Add source
  %e  Add event
  %o  Add other
</pre><p>

</p><pre class="screen">
  $s  List sources
  $n  List notes
  $$  List references
</pre><p>

</p><p>

     The handling of source, event and user-defined records in
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> is still in
     development. For example, sources cannot yet be searched by
     REFN or be deleted.

</p><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>s</strong></span>
<span class="action">Browse source records.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
This will bring up a list of all source records by number, showing
REFN, title, and author for each. A record may be selected
from this list to edit.
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>e</strong></span>
<span class="action">Browse event records.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
This will bring up a list of all event records by number. As of
yet this does not display any information about each event.
(Suggestions as to how to summarize events are welcome).
A record may be selected from this list to edit.
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>x</strong></span>
<span class="action">Browse other records.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>
This will bring up a list of all other records by number,
showing the 0 level line as summary. A record may be selected
from this list to edit.
</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>1</strong></span>
     <span class="action">Add a source record to the
     database.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

     This operation (or alternatively <span class="keycap"><strong>%s</strong></span> from the
     person, family or auxiliary browse screens) is used to add a
     new source record to the database.
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> creates a template source
     and puts you in the screen editor to edit the template. The
     default template is:

</p><pre class="programlisting">  0 SOUR
  1 REFN
  1 TITL <em class="replaceable"><code>Title</code></em>
  1 AUTH <em class="replaceable"><code>Author</code></em>

</pre><p>

</p><p>

     Do not change the <em class="structfield"><code>0 SOUR</code></em>
     line. Otherwise you may edit this record any way you like. The
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 REFN</code></em> line is a special line you
     can use to give the source a symbolic name that can be used in
     other records to refer to the source record. See the section
     on using <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> values. Because many
     sources have a title and an author, the default template has
     these lines. You may adjust the source template via the
     SOURREC user option (either at the database level, via the
     user options, or globally, via the configuration file). Here
     is how I recorded one of the sources in my database:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729111536"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.20. 
Example of a source record
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">0 SOUR
  1 REFN <strong class="userinput"><code>jcw</code></strong>
  1 TITL <strong class="userinput"><code>The Wetmore Family of America, and its Collateral Branches: with</code></strong>
    2 CONT <strong class="userinput"><code>Genealogical, Biographical, and Historical Notices</code></strong>
  1 AUTH <strong class="userinput"><code>James Carnahan Wetmore</code></strong>
  1 PUBL
    2 DATE <strong class="userinput"><code>1861</code></strong>
    2 PLAC <strong class="userinput"><code>Albany, New York</code></strong>
    2 INST <strong class="userinput"><code>Munsell and Rowland</code></strong>
    2 ADDR <strong class="userinput"><code>78 State Street</code></strong></pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

     The add source command in the x menu is equivalent to the
     <span class="keycap"><strong>%s</strong></span> command available in the person or family
     browse screen, in terms of entering the source record; after
     saving the source record though, there is one significant
     difference, in that that you then are presented with the
     following prompt (also, the key value of the new record is
     displayed in the status bar at this point):
</p><pre class="screen">
Please choose from the following options:
  1: Insert xref automatically at bottom of current record.
  2: Edit current record now to add xref manually.
  3: Browse new record (without adding xref).
  4: Return to current record (without adding xref).

 Commands:   j Move down     k Move up    i Select     q Quit
</pre><p>

     The four options perform the following actions:

     </p><p>

     1: LifeLines adds a reference to the new source record at the
     bottom of the person or family record that was visible in the
     display screen when you prompted LifeLines to create the new
     source record.

     </p><p>

     2: LifeLines will open the person or family record that was
     visible in the display screen when you prompted LifeLines to
     create the new source record, so that you can manually enter a
     reference to the newly created source record (perhaps as a
     source reference to an event that you are planning to add).

     </p><p>

     3: LifeLines lets you browse (and optionally reopen for
     editing) your newly added source record.

     </p><p>

     4: You are returned to the person or family record that was
     visible in the display screen when you prompted LifeLines to
     create the new source record. No reference is added to the new
     record.

     </p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>2</strong></span> <span class="action">Edit source record from the database.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

Use this operation to edit an existing source record already in
the database. When you select this operation
<span class="application">LifeLines</span> asks you to identify a source:
</p><pre class="screen">
Which source record do you want to edit?
enter key or refn:
</pre><p>


</p><p>

Identify a source by entering its key value, with or without the leading S, or by entering its <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em>
value. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> retrieves the record and puts you in the editor with the record.

</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm"><span class="keycap"><strong>3</strong></span> <span class="action">Add an event record to the database.</span></span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>

This operation (or alternatively <span class="keycap"><strong>%e</strong></span> from the person,
family or auxiliary browse screens) adds a new event record to the
database.  <span class="application">LifeLines</span> creates a template
event and puts you in the screen editor to edit the template. The
default template is:
</p><pre class="programlisting">0 EVEN
  1 REFN
  1 DATE
  1 PLAC
  1 INDI
    2 NAME
    2 ROLE
  1 SOUR</pre><p>

</p><p>

     You may adjust the event template via the EVENREC user option (either
     at the database level, via the user options, or globally, via the
     configuration file).

</p><p>

     Do not change the <em class="structfield"><code>0 EVEN</code></em>
     line. Otherwise you may edit this record any way you like. The
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 REFN</code></em> line allows you to give this
     event a symbolic name you can use when you want to refer to
     this event from other records. See the section on using
     <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> values. The default template
     suggests that an event has a date, a place, and refers to
     persons in roles with respect to the event. There is far less
     experience with event-based <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym> than
     there is with simple person and family
     <acronym class="acronym">GEDCOM</acronym>. You may even be wondering why you
     would need event records when you can simply tuck events away
     in person and family records. This is a topic that may get
     covered in an appendix.

</p><p>

     The add event command in the x menu is equivalent to the
     <span class="keycap"><strong>%e</strong></span> command available in the person or family
     browse screen, in terms of entering the event record; after
     saving the event record though, there is one significant
     difference, in that that you then are presented with the
     following prompt (also, the key value of the new record is
     displayed in the status bar at this point):
</p><pre class="screen">
Please choose from the following options:
  1: Insert xref automatically at bottom of current record.
  2: Edit current record now to add xref manually.
  3: Browse new record (without adding xref).
  4: Return to current record (without adding xref).

     The four options perform the following actions:

     <em class="structfield"><code>FAM</code></em>,
     <em class="structfield"><code>SOUR</code></em> and
     <em class="structfield"><code>EVEN</code></em>. For example, if you keep
     record information about the ships that your North American
     immigrant ancestors arrived on, you would keep records about
     those ships in your database; the tag
     <em class="structfield"><code>SHIP</code></em> suggests itself for such
     records. The <em class="structfield"><code>1 REFN</code></em> line allows you
     to give this record a symbolic name you can use when you want
     to refer to it from other records. See the section on using
     <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> values. You may adjust the
     other template via the OTHR user option (either at the database
     level, via the user options, or globally, via the configuration
     file).

FAMILY STRUCTURE AND MERGING PERSONS AND FAMILIES
</h2></div></div></div><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> 3.0.2 has relaxed most of
     restrictions on family structure that were imposed by earlier
     versions. For example, a family record may have more than one
     parent/spouse of the same sex; a person may be a child in more
     than family. This is a controversial issue. Some users insist
     that family relationships should imply biological relatedness,
     and that all other relationships should be handled by
     different means. Others insist that non-traditional families
     (any number of parents/spouses of any sex) should be allowed,
     and that children can be members of more than one family (eg,
     natural family and adoptive
     family). <span class="application">LifeLines</span> no longer takes
     a position on this matter; you are free to set up families any
     way you like; the operations that add spouses and children to
     families no longer check for non-traditional arrangements. It
     is possible that a future release will include a user option
     to either disallow or to ask for confirmation about
     non-traditional relationships.

</p><p>

     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> provides features for
     merging persons together and for merging families
     together. The person merging feature is accessed from the
     tandem person browse mode, and the family merging feature is
     accessed from the tandem family browse mode. You browse to the
     two persons or families you want to merge and then use the j
     command. Merging is necessary when you discover that two or
     more person records, or two or more family records, represent
     the same person or family, respectively.

</p><p>

     Versions of <span class="application">LifeLines</span> prior to
     3.0.2 required that persons and families meet certain criteria
     before they could be merged. The criteria ensured that the
     merged persons and families would still meet traditional
     family structuring rules. With the relaxation of the
     structuring rules, restrictions on merging have also been
     removed. It is now possible to create non-traditional
     relationships by merging traditional persons and/or
     families. For example, if you merge two persons that happen to
     be children in two different families, the merged person will
     be a child in both families. If you want to maintain only
     traditional relationships in your database you may have to
     makes further to changes to relationships after you complete a
     merge operation.

LINKING RECORDS TOGETHER AND USING THE REFN FEATURE

</h2></div></div></div><p>

     Records in a <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database may
     refer to other records via cross-reference links. The
     lineage-linked references are maintained directly by
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> through operations found
     in the browsing mode menus.  These references are the links
     from a person to families (<em class="structfield"><code>1 FAMC</code></em>
     and <em class="structfield"><code>1 FAMS</code></em>), and the links from a
     family to persons (<em class="structfield"><code>1 HUSB</code></em>,
     <em class="structfield"><code>1 WIFE</code></em> and <em class="structfield"><code>1
     CHIL</code></em>). Because
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> maintains these links you
     are not allowed to change these lines when you are editing
     records. There are a couple of seeming exceptions to this
     rule. For example, you may change the order of <em class="structfield"><code>1
     CHIL</code></em> lines in a family record in order to change
     the order of children in a family, and you may change the
     order of <em class="structfield"><code>1 FAMS</code></em> lines in a person
     record to change the order of families the person was a spouse
     or parent in. These operations are allowed because they don't
     affect which person records refer to which family records and
     vice versa.

</p><p>

     Besides the lineage-links that are maintained by
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span>, you may place your own
     links in records.  Probably the most common example of this is
     referring events within a person record to the record of the
     information source for the event. For example:


</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729034816"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.21. 
Example of referring events from a person record
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">0 @I23@ INDI
  1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>Thomas/Whitmore/</code></strong>
  1 BIRT
    2 DATE <strong class="userinput"><code>about 1615</code></strong>
    2 PLAC <strong class="userinput"><code>England</code></strong>
    2 SOUR @S3@
...
0 @S3@ SOUR
  1 REFN <strong class="userinput"><code>cat</code></strong>
  1 TITL <strong class="userinput"><code>New England Marriages Prior to 1700</code></strong>
  1 AUTH <strong class="userinput"><code>Clarence Almon Torrey</code></strong>
...</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

The <em class="structfield"><code>2 SOUR</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>@S3@</code></em> line in the person record refers to the source record. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> allows any specific
structure within a record (in this case a birth event) to refer to another record. It is not possible to refer
to a specific location within another record, though this may be supported eventually.


</p><p>

This example implies that when linking one record to another you must know the key of the target
record (S3 in the example). This is not desirable because internal record keys may change when the
records are exported from one database or imported to another.

</p><p>

     Because internal key values are not permanent,
     <span class="application">LifeLines</span> allows you to assign a
     permanent user-defined key to any record in the database using
     the <em class="structfield"><code>1 REFN</code></em> line. The value of this
     line is a string that you choose as your permanent key value
     for the record. When adding a link to a record that has a user
     <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> key value, you may use that
     value instead of the internal key value. For example, when
     adding the person in the previous example you could edit the
     new record as follows:

</p><div class="example"><a id="idm139852729024704"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.22. 
Example of adding a new person
</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">0 INDI
  1 NAME <strong class="userinput"><code>Thomas/Whitmore/</code></strong>
  1 BIRT
    2 DATE <strong class="userinput"><code>about 1615</code></strong>
    2 PLAC <strong class="userinput"><code>England</code></strong>
    2 SOUR <strong class="userinput"><code>&lt;cat&gt;</code></strong></pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break" />

</p><p>

     Instead of using the actual key value of the source, S3, the
     <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> value cat was used. The
     <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> value must be enclosed by
     angle brackets when used this
     way. <span class="application">LifeLines</span> automatically
     replaces the <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> link with the
     proper internal key value when the record is stored in the
     database.


</p><p>

     The <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> value may also be used
     when searching for person, source, event and user-defined
     records.  You should not add more than one
     <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> line to a record, and every
     <em class="structfield"><code>REFN</code></em> value should be unique.

LIFELINES REPORTS

</h2></div></div></div><p>

Lifelines comes with some prewritten reports, in the reports directory. See
the file index.html in the reports directory, for a list and summary of these
reports. Lifelines also has a built-in report language for writing your own
reports, and comes with a report manual describing how to write reports: see
the separate lifelines report manual (ll-reportmanual.html, or
ll-reportmanual.pdf).

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm139852729015088"></a>

System and User Properties

</h2></div></div></div><p>
There are a number of properties that can be specified to customize
the behavior of <span class="application">LifeLines</span>.  These properties can 
be specified in <span class="application">LifeLines</span>
configuration files, in each <span class="application">LifeLines</span> database 
or in some cases by environment variables.
</p><p>
System Properties are properties that have a predefined meaning to lifelines,
such as LLEDITOR (see its meaning below).  User Properties typically have no
predefined meanings as they are simply a string that a report looks up in the
property tables.  It can be anything a user desires.  To simplify report
writing a number of User Properties are predefined with specific meanings.
These User Property Names begin with 'user.' and are listed below.  For
example, many reports have abstracted the concept of the user's name to
the property user.fullname.  By defining this property in your llines startup
file, it allows a report to reference your name as the source of the data
being printed without having it hard-coded in the report.
</p><p>
When <span class="application">LifeLines</span> begins execution, it reads any
specified configuration files and extracts Properties from the files read.
It is possible for multiple configuration files to be read.  Properties
defined in these files will be stored in the global property table.  If
multiple definitions of the same property are seen, the latest definition
overrides prior definitions.  Configuration files are read as follows:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col width="0.5in" /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Note:</td><td>
If a configuration file defines LLCONFIGFILE, it is not entered in the global
table, but the value of this parameter is read as a configuration file after
completion of reading the current file.
</td></tr><tr><td>Note:</td><td>
In the following, the name of a user configuration file is listed as
.linesrc.  On windows versions of lifelines this name is lines.cfg.
</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>
If a configuration file name is passed to the program with the -C option,
or if LLCONFIGFILE is defined as an environment variable use the value
supplied as the name of the configuration file.  Do not read configuration
information from the files listed in 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d.
</td></tr><tr><td>2a</td><td>
If the file /etc/lifelines.conf exists, read it.  '/etc' is a placeholder for
the standard location for system configuration files as defined when 
lifelines was built.  It is often /etc or /usr/local/etc.
</td></tr><tr><td>2b.</td><td>
If the file $HOME/.linesrc exists, load parameters from it.
</td></tr><tr><td>2c.</td><td>
If the file .linesrc exists in the current directory read parameters from it.
</td></tr><tr><td>2d</td><td>
If LLCONFIGFILE is defined in the command line or database table and its 
value is the name of a file, load parameters from that file.
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>

<em class="glossterm">GedcomCodeset</em> is used. Most Gedcom files should
contain a codeset property, so this is not usually relevant when reading a Gedcom

when writing out a Gedcom file.

dbverify
</h3></div></div></div><p>
dbverify is a utility to check an existing database and report on various
inconsistencies.  It can also repair a number of issues found.
</p><p>
dbverify supports the following options:

btedit
</h3></div></div></div><p>
This program edits raw binary btree blocks in a 
<span class="application">LifeLines</span> lifelines database file.
Some information about its usage is provided by running:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
btedit -h
</pre><p>
Do NOT use this unless
you know what you are doing and you have backed up
your database.
</p><p>
The 
<span class="application">LifeLines</span> database has proven rather robust over
the years.  However, it is important to make frequent backups of any
database.  If you experience database corruption, make sure you save a copy
of the database before trying any recovery process.  Only work on a copy of
the data so that the data is not further damaged.
</p><p>
Try exporting the database to a gedcom file from within 
<span class="command"><strong>llines</strong></span>.  Compare the saved file with previously saved
versions.  Editing the gedcom file to correct
issues is often easier than using btedit.

llexec
</h3></div></div></div><p>
llexec invokes the LifeLines report execution program without a GUI
for non-interactive processing of report programs.  The supported options are
the same as for <span class="command"><strong>llines</strong></span>.  
</p><p>
An example usage, which will open the database 'myfamily' and run the report
eol.ll is:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
llexec myfamily -x eol 
</pre><p>
Programs that require input, will prompt for that data and read from standard
input. If a program required the input of a 0 or 1 to control the output,
the following is one way to allow use of llexec in a script:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
echo "1" | llexec myfamily -x myprog 
</pre><p>
</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
