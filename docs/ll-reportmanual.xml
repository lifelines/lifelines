Introduction
</title>
    


<para>

     The <application>LifeLines</application> programming subsystem
     lets you produce reports in any style or layout. You may
     generate files in <application>troff</application>,
     <application>Postscript</application>,
     <application>TeX</application>, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or any
     other <acronym>ASCII</acronym>-based format, for further text
     processing and printing. You access the report generator by
     choosing the r command from the main menu. You may also use
     the programming subsystem to create query and other processing
     programs that write their results directly upon the
     screen. For example, there is a
     <application>LifeLines</application> program that computes the
     relationship between any two persons in a database.

</para>



<para>

     Each <application>LifeLines</application> program is written
     in the <application>LifeLines</application> programming
     language, and the programs are stored in normal files. When
     you direct <application>LifeLines</application> to run a
     program, it asks you for the name of the program file, asks
     you where you want the program's output written, and then runs
     the program.

Tutorial Ahnentafel report
</title>

<para>

     For example, say you want <application>LifeLines</application>
     to generate an ahnentafel (ancestor) report for Tom Wetmore.
	 Such a report would show Tom Wetmore, his parents, grandparents,
	 great-grandparents, and so on. It would like like the following:

     Here is a <application>LifeLines</application> program that
     generates this report:

    enqueue(alist, 1)     /* ancestor numbers for people on ilist */
	
	/*
	Our basic loop is we take the next person who needs to be displayed,
	display them, and then record their parents as needing to be displayed.
	*/
    while (indi, dequeue(ilist)) {
	  /* display person we just pulled off list */
      set(ahnen, dequeue(alist))
      d(ahnen) ". " name(indi) nl()
      if (e, birth(indi)) { " b. " long(e) nl() }
      if (e, death(indi)) { " d. " long(e) nl() }
	  /* add person's parents to list to display */
      if (par, father(indi)) {
        enqueue(ilist, par)
        enqueue(alist, mul(2,ahnen))
      }
      if (par,mother(indi)) {
        enqueue(ilist, par)
        enqueue(alist, add(1,mul(2,ahnen)))
      }
    }
  }

</programlisting></example>

</para>



<para>

     Say this program is in the file
     <filename>ahnentafel_tutorial</filename>. When you choose the
     <keycap>r</keycap> option from the main menu,
     <application>LifeLines</application> asks:

<screen>
What is the name of the report program?
enter string:
</screen>

</para>

<para>

     You enter
     <userinput><literal>ahnentafel_tutorial</literal></userinput>. Since the
     program generates a report,
     <application>LifeLines</application> asks where to write that
     report:

<screen>
What is the name of the output file?
enter file name:
</screen>

</para>



<para>

     You enter a file name, say
     <userinput><filename>my.ahnen</filename></userinput>.
     <application>LifeLines</application> reads the program ahnen,
     executes the program, and writes the report output to
     <filename>my.ahnen</filename>. <application>LifeLines</application>
     reports any syntax or run-time errors found while trying to
     run the program.


</para>



<para>

     A <application>LifeLines</application> program is made up of
     <type>procedures</type> and <type>functions</type>; every
     program must contain at least one <type>procedure</type> named
     <literal>main</literal>. The <literal>main</literal>
     <type>procedure</type> runs first; it may call other
     <type>procedures</type>, <type>functions</type> and
     <type>built-in functions</type>. In the ahnentafel example
     there is only one <type>procedure</type>.

</para>

<para>
     In the example program, there are some comments at the top,
     to tell the reader a bit about the program. The comments run
     from <literal>/*</literal> to <literal>*/</literal>, and are
     not necessary (but are suggested).

</para>


<para>

     A <type>procedure</type> body is a sequence of
     <type>statements</type>. In the example program, the first five
     <type>statements</type> are:

<programlisting>
getindi(indi)
list(ilist)
list(alist)
enqueue(ilist, indi)
enqueue(alist, 1)
</programlisting>
</para>



<para>

     The first <type>statement</type> calls the
     <function>getindi</function> (get individual) <type>built-in
     function</type>, which causes
     <application>LifeLines</application> to ask you to identify a
     person using the zip browse style of identification:

<screen>
Identify person for interpreted report
enter name:
</screen>


</para>



<para>

     After you identify a person, he or she is assigned to the
     variable <varname>indi</varname>. The next two
     <type>statements</type> declare two <type>list
     variables</type>, <varname>ilist</varname> and
     <varname>alist</varname>. <type>Lists</type> hold sequences of
     things; there are operations for placing things on lists,
     taking things off, and iterating through the list elements. In
     the example, <varname>ilist</varname> holds a list of
     ancestors, in ahnentafel order, who have not yet been reported
     on, and <varname>alist</varname> holds their respective
     ahnentafel numbers.


</para>



<para>

     The next two statements call the <function>enqueue</function>
     function, adding the first members to both lists. The person
     identified by the <function>getindi</function> function is
     made the first member of <varname>ilist</varname>, and the
     number one, this person's ahnentafel number, is made the first
     member of <varname>alist</varname>.

</para>



<para>

The rest of the program is:

<programlisting>
while (indi, dequeue(ilist)) {
  set(ahnen, dequeue(alist))
  d(ahnen) ". " name(indi) nl()
  if (e, birth(indi)) { " b. " long(e) nl() }
  if (e, death(indi)) { " d. " long(e) nl() }
  if (par, father(indi)) {
    enqueue(ilist, par)
    enqueue(alist, mul(2,ahnen))
  }
  if (par, mother(indi)) {
    enqueue(ilist, par)
   enqueue(alist, add(1,mul(2,ahnen)))
  }
}
</programlisting>

</para>



<para>

     This is a loop that iteratively removes persons and their
     ahnentafel numbers from the two lists, and then prints their
     names and birth and death information. If the persons have
     parents in the database, their parents and their parents'
     ahnentafel numbers are then put at the ends of the lists. The
     loop iterates until the list is empty.

</para>



<para>

     The loop is a <type>while</type> loop statement. The line:
<programlisting>
while (indi, dequeue(ilist)) {
</programlisting>
removes (via <function>dequeue</function>) a person from <varname>ilist</varname>, and assigns the person to variable <varname>indi</varname>. As long as there
are persons on <varname>ilist</varname>, another iteration of the loop follows.

</para>



<para>

The statement:<programlisting>

set(ahnen, dequeue(alist))</programlisting>is an <type>assignment</type> statement. The second argument is evaluated; its value is assigned to the first
argument, which must be a variable. Here the next number in <varname>alist</varname> is removed and assigned to variable
<varname>ahnen</varname>. This is the ahnentafel number of the person just removed from <varname>ilist</varname>.

</para>



<para>

The line:<programlisting>

d(ahnen) ". " name(indi) nl()</programlisting>contains four <type>expression</type> statements; when expressions are used as statements, their values, if any, are
treated as strings and written directly to the report output file. The <function>d</function> function converts its integer
argument to a numeric string. The ". " is a literal (constant) string value. The <function>name</function> function returns the
default form of a person's name. The <function>nl</function> function returns a string containing the newline character.

</para>



<para>

The next two lines:

<programlisting>
if (e, birth(indi)) { " b. " long(e) nl() }
if (e, death(indi)) { " d. " long(e) nl() }
</programlisting>

write out basic birth and death information about a person. These
lines are <type>if</type> statements. The second argument in the
conditional is evaluated and assigned to the first argument, which
must be a variable.  The first <type>if</type> statement calls the
birth function, returning the first birth event in a person's
record. If the event exists it is assigned to variable
<varname>e</varname>, and the <type>body</type> (the items between the
curly brackets) of the <type>if</type> statement is executed. The
<type>body</type> consists of three <type>expression</type>
statements: a literal, and calls to the <function>long</function> and
<function>nl</function> functions. <function>Long</function> takes an
<parameter>event</parameter> and returns the values of
the first <structfield>DATE</structfield> and
<structfield>PLAC</structfield> lines in the <type>event</type>.

</para>



<para>

Finally in the program is:<programlisting>

if (par, father(indi)) {
enqueue(ilist,par)
enqueue(alist,mul(2,ahnen))
}
if (par,mother(indi)) {
enqueue(ilist,par)
enqueue(alist,add(1,mul(2,ahnen)))
}</programlisting>

</para>



<para>

These lines add the father and mother of the current person, if either or both are in the database, to
<varname>ilist</varname>. They also compute and add the parents' ahnentafel numbers to <varname>alist</varname>. A father's ahnentafel
number is twice that of his child. A mother's ahnentafel number is twice that of her child plus one.
These values are computed with the <function>mul</function> and <function>add</function> functions.

<title>
Invoking Reports
</title>

<para>
As mentioned earlier, reports may be invoked interactively from the main
menu via the <keycap>r</keycap> option from the main menu. 
</para>

<para>
Alternatively, llines may be called with the -x option to have it
immediately run a report. For example, to have lifelines run the
example ahnentafel report above, on a database named wetmore, 
this command
<command>llines -x ahnentafel_tutorial wetmore</command>
would be used.
</para>

<para>
For more efficient operation from scripts, the lifelines
distribution includes a smaller program
<command>llexec</command>
which includes all functionality of lifelines except the
curses GUI. <command>llexec</command> is made specifically,
therefore, for invocations such as
<command>llexec -x ahnentafel_tutorial wetmore</command>

Procedures and Functions

</title>



<para>

A <application>LifeLines</application> program is made up of one or more <type>procedures</type> and <type>functions</type>. A <type>procedure</type> has format:<synopsis>proc name(params) { statements }</synopsis>

</para>



<para>

<symbol>Name</symbol> is the name of the <type>procedure</type>, <symbol>params</symbol> is an optional list of <type>parameters</type> separated by commas,
and <symbol>statements</symbol> is a list of statements that make up the <type>procedure</type> body. Report generation begins with
the first <type>statement</type> in the <type>procedure</type> named <literal>main</literal>. <type>Procedures</type> may call other <type>procedures</type> and <type>functions</type>.
<type>Procedures</type> are called with the <type>call</type> statement described below.When a <type>procedure</type> is called, the
<type>statements</type> making up its <type>body</type> are executed.

</para>



<para>

A function has format:<synopsis>func name(params) { statements }</synopsis>

</para>



<para>

<symbol>Name</symbol>, <symbol>params</symbol> and <symbol>statements</symbol> are defined as in <type>procedures</type>. <type>Functions</type> may call other <type>procedures</type> and
<type>functions</type>. When a <type>function</type> is called the <type>statements</type> that make it up are executed. A <type>function</type> differs from
a <type>procedure</type> by returning a <type>value</type> to the <type>procedure</type> or <type>function</type> that calls it. Values are returned by the
<type>return</type> statement, described below. <type>Recursive functions</type> are allowed. A <type>function</type> is called by invoking it
in an <type>expression</type>.

</para>

<para>
<type>Function</type> and <type>procedure</type> parameters are passed
by value except for <type>list</type>, <type>set</type> and <type>table</type>

<para>

You may comment your <application>LifeLines</application> programs using the following notation:<programlisting>

/*...comment text including any characters except */... */</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
These comments may be inserted anywhere in the program file.
</para>

<para>
You should put in some report header comments, because they will provide useful text for your report
when it is included in the report list seen by the user who uses the lifelines pick report menu
function. Report header comments are some specific comments at the top of the report, with keywords
preceded by @ signs. The following is an illustration of report header comments, with explanations
inside them:
</para>

<programlisting>
/*
* @progname The name of the report without the
extension. This shows in the pick report option.
* @version Version Number of the report. This
is stored here and not in the report name.

GEDCOM | RTF | XML | PostScript | etc.
* @description The first paragraph after this is
used to generate the description in the index.html.

<para>

Comments begin with a <literal>/*</literal> and end with a <literal>*/</literal>. Comments may appear on lines of their own or on lines
that have program constructs. Comments may span many lines. Comments may not be nested.

</para>



</sect1>



<sect1>



<title>

Statements

</title>



<para>

     There are a number of <type>statement</type> types. The
     simplest is an <type>expression</type> statement, an
     expression that is not part of any other
     <type>statement</type> or
     <type>expression</type>. <type>Expressions</type> are defined
     more fully below. An <type>expression</type> statement is
     evaluated, and if its value is
     <returnvalue>non-null</returnvalue> (non-zero), it is assumed
     to be a <type>string</type>, and written to the program output
     file. If its value is <returnvalue>null</returnvalue>, nothing
     is written to the output file. For example, the expression
     <synopsis>name(indi)</synopsis>, where <symbol>indi</symbol>
     is a person, returns the person's name and writes it to the
     output file. On the other hand, the expression
     <synopsis>set(n, nspouses(indi))</synopsis> assigns the
     variable <varname>n</varname> the number of spouses that
     person <varname>indi</varname> has, but since
     <function>set</function> returns
     <returnvalue>null</returnvalue>, nothing is written to the
     output file.

</para>



<para>

     The programming language includes <type>if</type> statements,
     <type>while</type> statements and <type>procedure call</type>
     statements, with the following formats:

     <synopsis>if ([varb,] expr) { statements }
               [ elsif ([varb], expr) { statements } ]*
                    [ else { statements } ]
     </synopsis>

     <synopsis>while ([varb,] expr ) { statements }</synopsis>

     <synopsis>call name(args)</synopsis>

</para>



<para>

Square brackets indicate optional parts of the statement syntax. An <type>if</type> statement is executed by first
evaluating the conditional expression in the <type>if</type> clause. If <returnvalue>non-zero</returnvalue>, the statements in the <type>if</type> clause are
evaluated, and the rest of the <type>if</type> statement, if any, is ignored. If the value is <returnvalue>zero</returnvalue>, and there is an <type>elsif</type>
clause following, the conditional in the <type>elsif</type> clause is evaluated, and if <returnvalue>non-zero</returnvalue>, the statements in
that clause are executed. <type>Conditionals</type> are evaluated until one of them is <returnvalue>non-zero</returnvalue>, or until there are no
more. If no conditional is <returnvalue>non-zero</returnvalue>, and if the <type>if</type> statement ends with an <type>else</type> clause, the statements in
the <type>else</type> clause are executed. There are two forms of <type>conditional</type> expressions. If the <type>conditional</type> is a
single <type>expression</type>, it is simply evaluated. If the <type>conditional</type> is a <type>variable</type> followed by an <type>expression</type>, the
<type>expression</type> is evaluated and its value is assigned to the variable.

</para>

<para>

Note that <type>if</type> treats null strings as false, but empty strings as true. This has the benefit that

<programlisting>
if (birth(indi))
</programlisting>

will return <returnvalue>true</returnvalue> if there is a BIRT record, even if it is empty, but will return false if there is no BIRT record
at all.

</para>

<para>

The <type>while</type> statement provides a looping mechanism. The <type>conditional</type> is evaluated, and if <returnvalue>non-zero</returnvalue>, the
<type>body</type> of the loop is executed. After each iteration the <type>expression</type> is reevaluated; as long as it remains
<returnvalue>non-zero</returnvalue>, the loop is repeated.


</para>



<para>

The <type>call</type> statement provides procedure calls. <symbol>Name</symbol> must match one of the <type>procedures</type> defined in the
report program. <symbol>Args</symbol> is a list of <type>argument</type> expressions separated by commas. <type>Recursion</type> is allowed.
When a <type>call</type> is executed, the values of its <type>arguments</type> are evaluated and used to initialize the
procedure's <type>parameters</type>. The <type>procedure</type> is then executed. When the <type>procedure</type> completes, execution
resumes with the first item after the call.

</para>



<para>

The following report language statements are commonly encountered only near the top of a report:
<synopsis>char_encoding(string)</synopsis>
<synopsis>require(string)</synopsis>
<synopsis>option(string)</synopsis>
<synopsis>include(string)</synopsis>
<synopsis>global(varb)</synopsis>

</para>



<para>

The <type>char_encoding</type> statement specifies what character encoding scheme is used by the report, so that the
report processor can correctly interpret bytes not in ASCII (e.g., accented letters). An example specifying a character
encoding common in Western Europe:


<programlisting>
char_encoding("ISO-8859-1")
</programlisting>

The <type>option</type> statement allows the report writer to specify options. The only option currently available is
"explicitvars", which causes any use of variables not previously declared or set to be reported as a parsing error. The
<type>require</type> statement allows the report writer to specify that this report needs a version of the report
interpreter no older than that specified.
The <type>include</type> statement includes the contents of another file into the current file; its <parameter>string</parameter> expression is
the name of another <application>LifeLines</application> program file. It is described in more detail below. The <type>global</type> statement
must be used outside the scope of any <type>procedure</type> or <type>function</type>; it declares a <parameter>variable</parameter> to have global scope.  The 
<parameter>variable</parameter> is initialized to 0.

</para>

<para>

The report language also includes the following statements, which mimic some common programming languages:

<synopsis>set(varb, expr)</synopsis>
<synopsis>continue()</synopsis>
<synopsis>break()</synopsis>
<synopsis>return([expr])</synopsis>

</para>




<para>

The <type>set</type> statement is the assignment statement; the <parameter>expression</parameter> is evaluated, and its value is assigned
to the <parameter>variable</parameter>. The <type>continue</type> statement jumps to the bottom of the current loop, but does not leave the
loop. The <type>break</type> statement breaks out of the most closely nested loop. The <type>return</type> statement returns from
the current <type>procedure</type> or <type>function</type>. <type>Procedures</type> have return statements without expressions; <type>functions</type>
have return statements with expressions. None of these statements return a value, so none has a direct
effect on program output.

Expressions

</title>



<para>

There are four types of expressions: <type>literals</type>, <type>numbers</type>, <type>variables</type> and built-in or user defined function
<type>calls</type>.


</para>



<para>

A <type>literal</type> is any string enclosed in double quotes; its value is 
itself. A <type>number</type> is any integer or floating point constant;
its value is itself. A <type>variable</type> is a named location that can be assigned different values during program
execution. The value of a <type>variable</type> is the last value assigned to it. <type>Variables</type> do not have fixed type; at
different times in a program, the same <type>variable</type> may be assigned data of completely different types. An
identifier followed by comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in parentheses, is either a <type>call</type> to a
built-in function or a <type>call</type> to a user-defined function.

</para>

<title>

Include Feature

</title>



<para>

The <application>LifeLines</application> programming language provides an <type>include</type> feature. Using this feature one <application>LifeLines</application>
program can refer to other <application>LifeLines</application> programs. This feature is provided by the include statement:<synopsis>include(string)</synopsis>where <symbol>string</symbol> is a quoted string that is the name of another <application>LifeLines</application> program file. When an include
statement is encountered, the program that it refers to is read at that point, exactly as if the contents of
included file had been in the body of the original file at that point. This allows you to create <application>LifeLines</application>
program library files that can be used by many programs. Included files may in turn contain <type>include</type>
statements, and so on to any depth. <application>LifeLines</application> will use the <envar>LLPROGRAMS</envar> shell variable, if set, to
search for the <type>include</type> files.  Each file included with a include
statement is only read once.  If multiple include statements are encountered
that include the same file, only the first statement has any effect.
</para>
<para>
The only main procedure actually executed is the one in the
report the user chose.  main procedures in other reports
which are included do not get run.  This allows a module intended
to be included in other programs to have a main procedure for test purposes.
If multiple functions or procedures with the same name are included 
(other than the name main) a runtime error is generated and the program
is not run.
</para>

Built-in Functions

</title>



<para>

There is a long list of <type>built-in functions</type>, and this list will continue to grow for some time. The first
subsection below describes the value types used in <application>LifeLines</application> programs; these are the types of <type>variables</type>,
<type>function parameters</type> and <type>function return values</type>. In the remaining sections the <type>built-in functions</type> are
separated into logical categories and described.

</glosslist>

<para>

In the summaries of <type>built-in functions</type> below, each function is shown with its <type>argument</type> types
and its <type>return</type> type.  The types are from the preceding list. Sometimes an <type>argument</type> to a
<type>built-in function</type> must be a <type>variable</type>; when this is so its type is given as
<varname>XXX_V</varname>, where <symbol>XXX</symbol> is one of the types above. The <type>built-ins</type> do not check
the types of their <type>arguments</type>. <type>Variables</type> can hold values of any type, though at any one time
they will hold values of only one type. Note that <type>EVENT</type> is a subtype of <type>NODE</type>, and
<type>BOOL</type> is a subtype of <type>INT</type>. Built-ins with type <type>VOID</type> actually return
<returnvalue>null</returnvalue> (zero) values.

</para>

<para>

Reference types (denoted above in parentheses) obey "pointer semantics", which is to say that assigning one to another
variable results in both variables pointing at the same data (no copy is made). Therefore, if you pass a string to a
function which changes the string, the caller does not see the change, because a string is not a reference type. On the
other hand, if you pass a table to a function which alters the table, the caller does see the change, because a table is
a reference type.

</para>

</sect1>

<title>
Iterators
</title>

<para>

The report generator provides a number of iterator statements
for looping through genealogical and other types of data.
For example, the <type>children</type> statement
iterates through the children of a family,
the <type>spouses</type> statement iterates through the spouses of a
person, and the <type>families</type> statement iterates through the families that a person is a spouse or parent in.
</para>
<para>
Usually the first argument to the iterator is an expression that evaluates to an
individual or a family.
The other arguments of the iterator are variable names that are set with values for each iteration.
The last argument is often a variable name used as a counter.
It starts with the value of one and is
increased by one for each iteration of the loop.  
After completion of the iteration, these variables have the value null.
</para>
<para>
     <synopsis>children(afam,indi,cnt) { commands }</synopsis>
For example, the first argument to
<type>children</type> is the family that the iterator will operate on.
This iterator will execute the block of commands for each child in the
specified family.  The second argument is set to each child in the family
in the order they are listed in the family and the third argument is the
loop counter which starts at one and is incremented by one each time the
the block of commands is executed.  The two variables indi and cnt will
have the value null after the iteration has completed.
</para>

<para>
For the purpose of traversing all records in the database, the following
iterators may be used:

<informaltable pgwide='0' frame='none'>
<tgroup cols='2'>
<colspec colwidth='1in'></colspec>
<tbody>
<row>
<entry>forindi</entry>
<entry>Iterate over all people</entry>

<entry>forfam</entry>
<entry>Iterate over all families</entry>

<row>
<entry>forothr</entry>
<entry>Iterate over all other recoure types</entry>
</row>

</tgroup>
</informaltable>

</para>

All the iterators are described in more detail later in the section where
their definition occurs.

<para>
<function>Add</function>, <function>sub</function>, <function>mul</function> 
and <function>div</function> do normal arithmetic of integer or floating values.
If any operand is float, the result is float.
Functions <function>add</function> and <function>mul</function> can have two to
32 arguments; the sum or product of the full set of arguments is computed.
Functions <function>sub</function> and <function>div</function> have 
two arguments each; <function>sub</function> subtracts its second argument
from its first, and <function>div</function> divides its first argument by its
second.
The <function>mod</function> function returns the remainder after dividing the
first parameter by the second. If the second argument to 
<function>div</function> or <function>mod</function> is zero,
these functions return 0 and generate a run time error.
<function>Exp</function> performs integer exponentiation.
<function>Neg</function> negates its argument.
The functions 
<function>float</function> and
<function>int</function>
can be used to explicitly convert a value to float or int where needed.
</para>



<para>
<function>Incr</function> and <function>decr</function> increment by one and decrement by one, respectively, the value of a variable. The
argument to both functions must be a variable.  These functions take an
optional second argument which is the amount to increment or decrement the
variable by. 
</para>



<para>
<function>And</function> and <function>or</function> do logical operations. Both functions take two to 32 arguments. All arguments are and'ed or
or'ed together, respectively. The arguments are evaluated from left to right, but only up to the point
where the final value of the function becomes known. <function>Not</function> does the logical not operation.
</para>



<para>
<function>Eq</function>, <function>ne</function>, <function>lt</function>, <function>le</function>, <function>gt</function> and <function>ge</function> evaluate the six ordering relationships between two integers.

<para>
These functions take a person as a parameter and return information about him or her.
</para>

<para>
<function>Name</function> returns the default name of a person; this is the name found on the first <structfield>1 NAME</structfield> line in the
person's record; the slashes are removed and the surname is made all capitals; <function>name</function> can take an
optional second parameter - if it is <returnvalue>true</returnvalue> the function acts as described above; if <returnvalue>false</returnvalue>, the surname is
kept exactly as it is in the record.
</para>

<para>
<function>Fullname</function> returns the name of a person in a variety of formats. If the second parameter is <returnvalue>true</returnvalue> the
surname is shown in upper case; otherwise the surname is as in the record. If the third parameter is
<returnvalue>true</returnvalue> the parts of the name are shown in the order as found in the record; otherwise the surname is given
first, followed by a comma, followed by the other name parts. The fourth parameter specifies the
maximum length field that can be used to show the name; various conversions occur if it is necessary to
shorten the name to fit this length.
</para>

<para>
<function>Surname</function> returns the surname of the person, as found in the first <structfield>1 NAME</structfield> line; the slashes are
removed. <function>Givens</function> returns the given names of the person in the same order and format as found in the
first <structfield>1 NAME</structfield> line of the record. <function>Trimname</function> returns the default name of the person trimmed to the
maximum character length given in the second variable.
</para>

<para>
<function>Birth</function>, <function>death</function>, and <function>burial</function> return the first birth, death, and burial event in the
person's record, respectively. An event is a level <structfield>1 GEDCOM</structfield> node. If there is no matching event these
functions return <returnvalue>null</returnvalue>.
</para>

<para>
<function>Father</function>, <function>mother</function>, <function>nextsib</function> and <function>prevsib</function> return the father, mother, next younger sibling and next older
sibling of the person, respectively. If the person has more than one father (mother) the <function>father</function>
(<function>mother</function>) function returns the first one. These functions return <returnvalue>null</returnvalue> if there is no person in the role.
</para>

<para>
<function>Sex</function> returns the person's sex as the string <returnvalue>M</returnvalue> if the person is male, <returnvalue>F</returnvalue> if the person is female, or <returnvalue>U</returnvalue> if the
sex of the person is not known. <function>Male</function> and <function>female</function> return <returnvalue>true</returnvalue> if the person is male or female,
respectively, or <returnvalue>false</returnvalue> if not.
</para>

<para>
<function>Pn</function> generates pronouns, useful when generating English text;
the second parameter selects the type of pronoun:

<para>
<function>Nspouses</function> returns the number of spouses the person has in the database, and <function>nfamilies</function> returns the
number of families the person is a parent/spouse in; these two values are not necessarily the same.
<function>Parents</function> returns the first family that the person is a child in.
</para>

<para>
<function>Title</function> returns the value of the first <structfield>1 TITL</structfield> line in the record. 
</para>

<para>
<function>Key</function> returns the key value of a person (or any record);
if there is a second parameter and it is non-null, the leading <literal>I</literal> (or <literal>F</literal> 
or <literal>S</literal> or <literal>E</literal> or <literal>X</literal>) will be stripped. For example, if
<literal>key(curindi)</literal> returns <literal>I23</literal>, then <literal>key(curindi,1)</literal>
returns <literal>23</literal>.
</para>

<para>
<function>Soundex</function>
returns the Soundex code of the person.
</para>

<para>
<function>Root</function> and <function>Inode</function> return the root node of the person's <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> node tree. Note that an <type>INDI</type> value is
not a <type>NODE</type> value. If you want to process the nodes within a person node tree, you must first use the
<function>root</function> or <function>inode</function> function to get the root of the person node tree. <function>Root</function> and <function>inode</function> are synonyms.
</para>

<para>
<function>Indi</function> returns the person whose key is passed as an argument;
if no person has the key <function>indi</function> returns
<returnvalue>null</returnvalue>.
INDI  keys are accepted either as Innn or @Innn@.
</para>

<para>
<function>Firstindi</function>, <function>nextindi</function> and <function>previndi</function> allow you to iterate through all persons in the database. <function>Firstindi</function>
returns the first person in the database in key order. <function>Nextindi</function> returns the next person after the
argument person in key order. <function>Previndi</function> returns the previous person before the argument person in key
order.
</para>

<para>
<function>Spouses</function> is an iterator that loops through each spouse a person has. The first argument is a person. The
second argument is a person variable that iterates through the first person's spouses. The third
argument is a family variable that iterates through the families the person and each spouse are in.
The fourth argument is an integer variable that counts the iterations.
The spouses iterator skips any family that has no spouse, whereas the
families iterator does not.
</para>

<para>
<function>Families</function> is an iterator that loops through the families a person was a spouse/parent in. The first
argument is a person. The second argument is a family variable that iterates through the families the
first person was a spouse/parent in. The third argument iterates through the spouses from the families;
if there is no spouse in a particular family, the variable is set to null for that iteration. The fourth
argument is an integer variable that counts the iterations.
</para>

<para>
<function>Families</function> and <function>Spouses</function> behave the same
except for one situation.  If the person is a spouse in a family that only has
one spouse identified,  that family does not show up with the 
<function>spouses</function> iterator, but it does show up with the
<function>families</function> iterator.  One caution, this situation causes
the 3rd argument of the <function>families</function> iterator to be set to
null.  You must check for this.
</para>

<para>
<function>Forindi</function> is an iterator that loops through every person in
the database in ascending key order. Its first
parameter is a variable that iterates through the persons; its second 
parameter is an integer counter
variable that counts the persons starting at one.
</para>

<para>
<function>mothers</function> is an iterator that loops through every female
parent of the specified individual. 
Its first parameter is a person;
its third parameter is a family variable that iterates through the familes
that the person is a child in;
its second parameter is a person variable that is the female parent
associated with the family in the third parameter;
The fourth parameter is a variable that counts the families returned starting at one.
</para>


<para>
<function>Parents</function> is an iterator that loops through every family
that a person is a child in.  Note: This iterator's name begins with a
capital P.  There is another function of the same name that begins with a
lower case p.
Its first parameter is a person;
its second parameter is a family variable that iterates through the familes
that the person is a child in; and
the third parameter is a variable that counts the families returned starting at one.
</para>

<para>
<function>Forindi</function> is an iterator that loops through every person in
the database in ascending key order. Its first
parameter is a variable that iterates through the persons; its second 
parameter is an integer counter
variable that counts the persons starting at one.
</para>

<para>
<function>fathers</function> and
<function>mothers</function> are iterators that loop through each family
the specified individual is in returns each father or mother found.
If a non-traditional family is processed, there will be separate iterations
for each father or mother found.

<para>
<application>LifeLines</application> provides general purpose lists that can be accessed as queues, stacks or arrays. A
list must be declared with the <function>list</function> function before it can be used. Redeclaring an existing
variable with the <function>list</function> clears it and restores it to being 
an empty list.  If the argument to list() is the name of a
parameter to the current routine, the reference to the calling routines
list is removed and a new list is created.
</para>

<para>
A list can have any number of elements. <function>Empty</function> returns <returnvalue>true</returnvalue> if the list
has no elements and <returnvalue>false</returnvalue> otherwise. <function>Length</function> returns the length of the
list. The only parameter to both is a list.  The following diagram
indicates how the various access functions for a list interact:
</para>
<para>
<inlinemediaobject>
<imageobject> <imagedata fileref="listops.jpg" format="JPG"/>
</imageobject>
</inlinemediaobject>
</para>

<para>
<function>Enqueue</function>, <function>dequeue</function> and <function>requeue</function> provide queue access to a
list.  <function>Enqueue</function> adds an element to the back of a queue, <function>dequeue</function> removes and
returns the element from the front of a queue, and <function>requeue</function> adds an element to the front of a queue.
The first parameter to all three is a list, and the second parameter to <function>enqueue</function> and
<function>requeue</function> is the value to be added to the queue and can be any value.
</para>

<para>
<function>Push</function> and <function>pop</function> provide stack access to a list. <function>Push</function> pushes
an element on the stack, and <function>pop</function> removes and returns the most recently pushed element from the
stack. The first parameter to both is a list, and the second parameter to <function>push</function> is the value to be
pushed on the stack and can be of any type.
</para>

<para>
<function>Setel</function> and <function>getel</function> provide array access to a list.  <function>Setel</function>
sets a value of an array element, and <function>getel</function> returns the value of an array element. The first
parameter to both is a list; the second parameter to both is an integer index into the array; and the third parameter to
<function>setel</function> is the value to assign to the array element and can be of any type. Array elements are
indexed starting at one. Unassigned elements are assumed to be <returnvalue>null</returnvalue>
(<returnvalue>0</returnvalue>). Arrays automatically grow in size to accommodate the largest index value that is used.
Passing 0 references the last element at the other end from 1, and -1 the one before it, etc. 
</para>

<para>
<function>inlist</function> compares the second argument with each element
in the list.  If it finds a match <function>inlist</function> returns
<returnvalue>true</returnvalue>.
</para>

<para>
<function>sort</function> and <function>rsort</function> sort a list, using the elements of the second array to
determine the new order. Both lists are reordered, so essentially both are sorted using the sort order of the second
argument. (If only one argument is given, it is sorted on its own elements.) 
rsort sorts in order reverse of sort.
The order that sort produces places the smallest element at position 1, and the
largest element at the end of the list, such that <function>dequeue</function> 
will remove the smallest element.
</para>

<para>
<function>dup</function> creates a copy of a <type>list</type>.  If b is a 
<type>list</type>, the function <function>set</function>(a,b) makes the variable a a reference 
to the <type>list</type> b.  If you
want to make a new <type>list</type>, you must use 
<function>set</function>(a,<function>dup</function>(b)).
</para>

<para>
<function>Forlist</function> is an iterator that loops through the element in a list. Its first parameter is a
<type>LIST</type> expression; its second parameter is a variable that iterates through the list elements; and its third
parameter is an integer counter variable that counts the list elements starting at one.

<para>
These functions provide general purpose, keyed tables. A table must be declared with the <function>table</function>
function before it can be used.
</para>

<para>
<function>Insert</function> adds an object and its key to a table. Its first parameter is a table; the second parameter
is the object's key; and the third parameter is the object itself. The key must be a string and the object can be any
value. If there already is an object in the table with that key, the old object is replaced with the new.
</para>

<para>
<function>Lookup</function> retrieves an object from a table. Its first parameter is a table, and the second parameter
is the object's key. The function returns the object with that key from the table; if there is no such object,
<returnvalue>null</returnvalue> is returned.
<function>length</function> returns the number of elements in the table.

<para>

These functions provide access to the components of a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> node. All take a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> node as their
only parameter, and each returns a different value associated with the node.

</para>

<para>
<function>Xref</function> returns the cross reference index of the node, if any; <function>tag</function> returns the tag of the node; and <function>value</function>
returns the value of the node, if any. If there is no cross reference, <function>xref</function> returns <returnvalue>null</returnvalue>; if there is no value,
value returns <returnvalue>null</returnvalue>.
</para>

<para>
<function>Parent</function> returns the parent node of the node, if any; <function>child</function> returns the first child node of the node, if any;
and <function>sibling</function> returns the next sibling node of the node, if any. Whenever there is no such related node,
these functions return <returnvalue>null</returnvalue>. These three functions allow simple navigation through a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> node
tree.
</para>

<para>
<function>Savenode</function> makes a copy of the node, and the substructure of nodes below the node, that is passed to it.
Beware: the memory used to make the copy is never returned to the system.
</para>

<para>
The <function>level</function> function returns the level of the node.
</para>


<para>
<function>Fornodes</function> is an iterator that loops through the child nodes of a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> node. Its first argument is a
node expression, and its second parameter is a variable that iterates through each direct child node of
the first node.
</para>

<para>
<function>Fornotes</function> is an iterator that loops through the NOTE nodes 
of a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> node. Its first argument is a
node expression, and its second parameter is a variable that returns the
value of the NOTE.  The value includes processed sub CONC and CONT records.
</para>



<para>
<function>Traverse</function> is an iterator providing a general method for traversing <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> trees. Its first parameter is
a node expression; its second parameter is a variable that iterates over every node under the first node
in a top down, left to right manner; and its third parameter is a variable that is set to the level of the
current node in the iteration.

<para>
These functions extract information about the dates and places of events.
</para>

<para>
<function>Date</function> returns the value of the first <structfield>DATE</structfield> line in an event, a node in a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> record tree. <function>Date</function>
finds the first <structfield>DATE</structfield> line one level deeper than the event node. <function>Place</function> returns the value of the first
<structfield>PLAC</structfield> line in an event. <function>Year</function> returns the first three or four digit number in the value of the first <structfield>DATE</structfield>
line in an event; this number is assumed to be the year of the event.
</para>

<para>
<function>Long</function> returns the verbatim values of the first <structfield>DATE</structfield> and <structfield>PLAC</structfield> lines in an event, concatenated together
and separated by a comma. <function>Short</function> abbreviates information from the first <structfield>DATE</structfield> and <structfield>PLAC</structfield> lines, concatenates the shortened information together with a comma separator and returns it. An abbreviated
date is its year; an abbreviated place is the last component in the value, further abbreviated if the
component has an entry in the place abbreviation table.
</para>

<para>
<function>Gettoday</function> creates an event that has today's date in the <structfield>DATE</structfield> line.
<function>Setdate</function> creates an event that has the specified date in the <structfield>DATE</structfield> line,
and assigns the new event to the specified variable.
</para>

<para>
The next seven functions are used to format dates in a variety of ways.
<function>Dayformat</function>, <function>monthformat</function>,
<function>yearformat</function>, <function>eraformat</function>, and
<function>dateformat</function> select style options for formatting the day,
month, year, era, and overall date structure; <function>stddate</function>
returns dates in the selected style.
<function>datepic</function> allows specifying a custom pattern that overrides
the date format selected with <function>dateformat</function>.  The string
supplied specifies the placement of the day, month and year in the string with
%d, %m and %y.  A null argument disables the overrided format.
The argument to <function>stddate</function> is normally an event and the
date is extracted from the event and formatted. If the argument is a 
date string it is converted using the current date formats.
</para>

<para>
The next three functions provide for more complex formatting of dates. Taking
into account the abt, est, cal, bef, aft, fr and to qualifiers on GEDCOM dates. 
<function>complexformat</function> selects the format to use. The format
effects only the complex picture, not the format of the date itself.
The function
<function>complexpic</function> can be used to specify a custom picture string
for any or all of the 9 custom format strings.  The custom string can be
canceled by passing a null for the string.  When a custom picture string is
provided it overrides both the abbreviated and full word picture strings.
<function>complexdate</function>
formats the date similarly to <function>stddate</function>, but with the 
addition of the complex date format string selected.

</para>
</glossdef></glossentry>

</glosslist>

<para>
Value extraction functions read the values of certain lines and return those values in extracted form.
</para>

<para>
<function>Extractdate</function> extracts date values from either an event node
or <structfield>DATE</structfield> node. The first parameter must be
a node; if its tag is <structfield>DATE</structfield>, the date is extracted 
from the value of that node; if its tag is not <structfield>DATE</structfield>,
the date is extracted from the first <structfield>DATE</structfield> line one 
level below the argument node. The remaining three arguments are variables.
The first is assigned the integer value of the extracted day; the second is
assigned the integer value of the extracted month; and the third is assigned
the integer value of the extracted year.
</para>

<para>
<function>Extractnames</function> extracts name components from a <structfield>NAME</structfield> line. Its first argument is either an <structfield>INDI</structfield> or a
<structfield>NAME</structfield> node. If it is a <structfield>NAME</structfield> line, the components are extracted from the value of that node; if it is an
<structfield>INDI</structfield> line, the components are extracted from the value of the first <structfield>NAME</structfield> line in the person record.
The second argument is a list that will hold the extracted components. The third argument is an integer
variable that is set to the number of extracted components. The fourth argument is a variable that is set
to the index (starting at one) of the surname component; the <literal>/</literal> characters are removed from around the
surname component. If there is no surname this argument variable is set to zero.
</para>

<para>
<function>Extractplaces</function> extracts place components
from a <structfield>PLAC</structfield> node. The first
argument is a node; if its tag is
<structfield>PLAC</structfield>, the places are extracted from
the value of the node; if its tag is not
<structfield>PLAC</structfield>, places are extracted from the
first <structfield>PLAC</structfield> line one level below the
argument node. The second parameter is a list that will hold
the extracted components. The third argument is an integer
variable that is set to the number of extracted
components. Place components are defined by the
comma-separated portions of the
<structfield>PLAC</structfield> value; leading and trailing
white space is removed from the components, while all internal
white space is retained.
</para>

<para>
<function>Extracttokens</function> extracts tokens from a
string and places them in a list. The first argument is the
string to extract tokens from. The second argument is the list
to hold the tokens. The third argument is an integer variable
that is set to the number of tokens extracted. The fourth
parameter is the string of delimiter characters that
<function>extracttokens</function> uses to break the input
string into tokens.
</para>

<para>
<function>extractdatestr</function> extracts date values from a .
<structfield>STRING</structfield>.  It is intended for internal verification
of date extraction code.
The remaining five arguments are variables.
The second is assigned the integer value of the extracted day; the third is
assigned the integer value of the extracted month; and the fourth is assigned
the integer value of the extracted year.

<para>
These functions provide string handling. Prior to version 3.0.6, many of them used an approach to memory management
chosen for absolute minimal memory footprint. A function using this approach constructed its output string in its own string
buffer, reusing that buffer each time it was called. When a function using this approach returned a string
value it returned its buffer. In consequence the strings returned by these functions were to be either used or
saved before the function was called again.
</para>

<para>
<function>Lower</function> and <function>upper</function> convert the letters
in their arguments to lower or upper case, respectively.
<function>Capitalize</function> converts the first character of the argument,
if it is a letter, to upper case. <function>Lower</function> and
<function>upper</function> historically used the buffer return method;
<function>capitalize</function> operates on and returns its argument.
<function>titlecase</function> converts the first letter of each word if it is
a letter, to upper case and all other characters to lower case.
</para>

<para>
<function>Trim</function> shortens a string to the length specified by the second parameter. If the string is already of that
length or shorter the string is not changed. <function>Rjustify</function> right justifies a string into another string of the
length specified by the second parameter. If the original string is shorter than the justified string,
blanks are inserted to the left of the original string; if the string is longer than the justified string, the
original string is truncated on the right. <function>Trim</function> historically used the buffer return method; <function>rjustify</function> creates and returns
a new string.
</para>

<para>
<function>Concat</function> and <function>strconcat</function> catenate strings and return the result. They are identical functions. They may
take two to 32 string arguments; null arguments are allowed. The arguments are concatenated together into
a single, newly allocated string, which is returned.
</para>

<para>
<function>Strlen</function> returns the length of the string argument.
</para>

<para>
<function>Substring</function> returns a substring of the first argument string. The second and third arguments are the
indices of the first and last characters in the argument string to use to form the substring. The indexes are relative one.
<function>Substring</function> historically used the buffer return method.
</para>

<para>
<function>Index</function> returns the character index of the nth occurrence of a substring within a string. The index is the
relative one character offset to the beginning of the substring. The first argument is the string; the
second argument is the substring; and the third argument is the occurrence number.
</para>

<para>
<function>D</function>, <function>card</function>, <function>ord</function>,
<function>alpha</function> and <function>roman</function> convert integers
to strings. <function>D</function> converts an integer to a numeric string;
<function>card</function> converts an integer to a cardinal number string 
(eg, <literal>one, two, three</literal>); <function>ord</function> converts an
integer to an ordinal number (eg, <literal>first, second, third</literal>);
<function>alpha</function> converts an integer to a letter
(eg, <literal>a, b, c</literal>); and <function>roman</function> converts an 
integer to a Roman numeral (eg, <literal>i, ii, iii</literal>).
</para>

<para>
The <function>f</function> function converts a float to a string.  The
optional second argument specifies the precision of the output.  The default
precision is 2.
</para>
<para>
<function>Strsoundex</function> converts an arbitrary string to a SOUNDEX value. Non-ASCII text characters are ignored
in the string.
</para>

<para>
<function>Strtoint</function> converts a numeric string to an integer. <function>Atoi</function> is identical to <function>strtoint</function>.
</para>

<para>
<function>Strcmp</function> compares two strings and returns an integer that is less than zero, equal to zero, or greater than
zero, if, respectively, the first string is lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than the second
string. <function>Eqstr</function> and <function>nestr</function> return whether two strings are equal or not equal, respectively.
<function>Strcmp</function>, <function>Eqstr</function>, and <function>nestr</function> all treat null strings as empty strings,
which is to say they pretend that a null string is actually "". This means that all null and empty strings compare as equal.

<para>
Reports can be generated in two modes, line mode and page mode. <function>Linemode</function> selects line mode and
<function>pagemode</function> selects page mode; line mode is the default. The first parameter to <function>pagemode</function> is the number
of rows per page; the second parameter is the number of columns per page. When in the line mode report
output is written directly to the output file as the program runs, line by line. When in page mode output
is buffered into pages which are written to the output file when <function>pageout</function> is called. Page mode is useful
for generating charts (eg, pedigree charts or box charts) where it is convenient to compute the two-dimensional
location of output.
</para>

<para>
<function>Col</function> positions output to the given column. If the current 
column is greater than the argument, col
positions output to the given column on the next line. <function>Col</function>
works in both modes.
<function>Getcol</function> returns the current column in the output.
</para>

<para>
<function>Row</function> positions output to the first character in the given row; <function>row</function> can only be used in page mode.
</para>

<para>
<function>Pos</function> positions output to a specified row and column coordinate; the first argument specifies the row, and
the second specifies the column. <function>Pos</function> can only be used in page mode.
</para>

<para>
<function>Nl</function> write a new line character to the output file; <function>sp</function> writes a space character to the output file; and <function>qt</function>
writes a quote character to the output file. Note that <literal>\n</literal> and <literal>\'</literal> can be used within string values to
represent the newline and double quote characters.
</para>

<para>
<function>Newfile</function> specifies the name of the report output file. Its first argument is the file's name; its second
argument is an append flag - if its value is non-zero the report appends to this file; if its value is zero
the report overwrites the contents of the file. <function>Newfile</function> can be called many times; this allows a single report program to generate many report output files during one execution. Programs are not required to
use <function>newfile</function>; if it is not used then <application>LifeLines</application> automatically asks for the name of the report output file.
</para>

<para>
<function>Outfile</function> returns the name of the current report output file.
</para>

<para>
<function>Copyfile</function> copies the contents of a file to the report output file; its argument is a string whose value is
the name of a file; if the file name is not absolute nor relative, then the <envar>LLPROGRAMS</envar> environment
variable, if set, will be used to search for the file; the file is opened and its contents copied to the report
output file.
</para>

<para>
<function>Test</function> will check for a specified property of the specified file.  The first argument is the property, the second argument is the filename.
Supported properties are:
r - file is readable
w - file is writeable
x - file is executable
s - file has non-zero size
z - file has zero size
e - file exists
f - check if argument is a file
d - check if argument is a directory

The return value is TRUE or FALSE, depending on whether the file had the specified property or not.
</para>

<para>
<function>Print</function> prints its argument string to the standard output window; <function>print</function> may have one to 32 arguments.

<para>
These functions allow you to manipulate person sets. A person set is a potentially large set of persons;
each person may have an arbitrary value associated with him/her. A person set must be declared with
the <function>indiset</function> function before it can be used.
</para>

<para>
<function>Addtoset</function> adds a person to a set. The first argument is the set; the second argument is the person; and
the third argument may be any value. The same person may be added to a set more than once, each time
with a different value. <function>Deletefromset</function> removes a person from a set. The first argument is the set; the
second argument is the person; if the third parameter is <returnvalue>true</returnvalue> all of the person's entries are removed
from the set; if <returnvalue>false</returnvalue> only the first entry is removed. 
<function>Length</function> returns the number of persons in a person set.
</para>

<para>
<function>Union</function>, <function>intersect</function> and <function>difference</function>
return the set union, set intersection and set difference, respectively, of two person sets.
Each functions takes two person sets as arguments and returns a third person set. The
functions actually modify their argument sets, both reordering them into canonical key order
and removing any duplicates (these operations are necessary to easily implement these types
of set functions).
</para>

<para>
<function>Parentset</function>, <function>childset</function>, <function>spouseset</function> and <function>siblingset</function> return the set of all parents, set of all children, set of
all spouses and set of all siblings, respectively, of the set of persons in their argument. In all cases there
is no change to the argument person set.
</para>

<para>
<function>Ancestorset</function> returns the set all ancestors of all persons in the argument set. <function>Descendentset</function> returns the
set of all descendents of all persons in the argument set. <function>Descendantset</function> is the same as <function>descendentset</function>; it allows an alternate spelling.
</para>

<para>
<function>Uniqueset</function> sorts a person set by key value and then removes all entries with duplicate keys; the input
set is modified and returned.
</para>

<para>
<function>Namesort</function>, <function>keysort</function> and <function>valuesort</function> sort a set of persons by name, by key and by associated value,
respectively.
</para>

<para>
Each person in a person set has an associated value. When a person is added to a set with <function>addtoset</function>, the
value is explicitly assigned. When new sets are created by other functions, a number of rules are used to
associate values with persons as they are added to the new sets. For <function>parentset</function>, <function>childset</function> and
<function>spouseset</function> the values are copied from the first input set person that causes the new person to be added
to the set. For <function>union</function>, <function>intersect</function> and <function>difference</function>, the values are copied from the values in the first input
set, except in the case of <function>union</function>, when persons are taken from the second set alone, in which case the
values come from there. For <function>ancestorset</function> and <function>descendantset</function> the value is set to the number of generations
the new person is away from the <emphasis>first</emphasis> person in the input set that the new person is related to. If the
new person is related to more than one person in the input set, the value is set for the nearest
relationship; that is, the value is as low as possible. <function>Valuesort</function> sorts a person set by the values of these
auxiliary values.
</para>

<para>
<function>Genindiset</function> generates the set of persons that matches a string whose value is a name in <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym>
format. <function>Genindiset</function> uses the same algorithm that matches names entered at the browse prompt or by
the user interaction <function>getindiset</function> function.
</para>

<para>
<function>Inset</function> returns <returnvalue>true</returnvalue> if the
the specified individual is in the SET.
</para>

<para>
<function>Forindiset</function> is an iterator that loops through each person in an indiset. The first parameter is an indiset.
The second parameter is a variable that iterates through each person in the set. The third parameter
iterates through the values associated with the persons. The fourth parameter is an integer variable
that counts the iterations.

<para>
<function>Createnode</function> creates a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> node; the two arguments are tag and value strings,
respectively; the value string can be <returnvalue>null</returnvalue>. <function>Addnode</function> adds a node to a
node tree. The first argument is the new node; the second is the node in the tree that becomes the parent of the new
node; the third is the node in the tree that becomes the previous sibling of the new node; this argument is
<returnvalue>null</returnvalue> if the new node is to become the first child of the parent.
<function>Detachnode</function> removes a node from a node tree. <function>writeindi</function> writes an individual
record back to the database, and <function>writefam</function> writes a family record back to the database, allowing the
report to make permanent changes to the database.
</para>

<para>
These functions allow you to recognize values that are cross references and to read the records they refer
to. <function>Reference</function> returns <returnvalue>true</returnvalue> if its string argument is a cross reference value, that is, the internal key of
one of the records in the database. <function>Dereference</function> returns the node tree of the record referred to by its cross-reference string argument.

<para>

<function>Lock</function> and <function>unlock</function> are used to lock a
person or family into <acronym>RAM</acronym> memory, and to unlock a person or family
from <acronym>RAM</acronym> memory, respectively.

</para>

<para>
<function>Database</function> returns the name of the current database, useful
in titling reports. <function>program</function> returns the
name of the current report program. <function>Version</function> returns the
version of the running <application>LifeLines</application> program, eg, <literal>&llversion;</literal>.
</para>

<para>
<function>System</function> executes its string argument as a
<acronym>UNIX</acronym> (or <acronym>MS-Windows</acronym> as appropriate) shell
command, by invoking the system shell. This will not occur if the user has
chosen to disallow report system calls (via the DenySystemCalls user option).
</para>

<para>
The <function>heapused</function> function returns the amount of system heap
that is in use at the time.  This is implemented only on windows.
</para>

<para>
The <function>getproperty</function> function extracts system or user
properties.  Properties are named group.subgroup.property,
group.property or even property.  The keys are available at the moment can 
be found in the ll-userguide under System and User Properties.
</para>

<para>
The <function>setlocale</function> function sets the locale and returns
the previous setting of locale.
</para>

<para>
The <function>bytecode</function> function converts the supplied string
with escape codes to the current codeset from the internal codeset or
from the codeset specified by the
optional second parameter if specified.  A escaped code is a dollar sign ($)
followed by 2 hex characters, e.g. $C1.
</para>

<para>
The <function>convertcode</function> function converts a string to another
codeset.  In the two argument form, the second argument is the destination
codeset, and the source codeset is the internal codeset.  In the 3 argument
form, the second argument is the source codeset and the third argument is the
destination codeset.  (See the section of the LifeLines User Guide on codeset
conversions.)  For example, if your internal codeset is UTF-8, and the report 
codeset is UTF-8, the following code,
<programlisting>       "&lt;p&gt;\n"
       convertcode(str,"UTF-8//html")
</programlisting>
writes the first line of output as it is written, but will apply the html
sub-conversion to all the characters in the string str. The special
html codes, like the less than or greater than, will be escaped when printing
the second string, but not when printing the first string.
</para>

<para>
The <function>debug</function> function turns on or off programming debugging.
When enabled gobs of information is printed as a 
<application>LifeLines</application> program is run.  This can be useful
to figure out why a program is not behaving as expected.
</para>

<para>
The <function>pvalue</function> function returns a string that represents
the contents of a variable in the interpreter.  This is present for debug
purposes.
</para>

<para>
The function <function>free</function> deallocates space associated with the
variable provided as argument 1. Care must be taken when free is used in a
function on a variable which is a parameter to the function.  free will not
effect the variable in the calling program.

The <function>baptism</function> finds christening (CHR) events.  The types of
events desired to be found, depend on the nature of the report being written.
It is recommended that custom access routines be used instead of 
<function>baptism</function>.

</para>

<para>
If you want a routine that returns the first event for an individual that is a
baptism, LDS baptism, Christening or Adult Christening, the following routine
can be used.

    <synopsis>func get_baptism(indi) {
    fornodes(indi,node) {
        if (index(" BAPM BAPL CHR CHRA ",upper(tag(node)),1)) {
            return(node)
        }
    }
    return(0)
}</synopsis>
If you want to search for additional events or fewer events you can modify the
string in the index call acccordingly.  Likewise, if you want the to prioritize
the results, finding a christening event if one exists, else finding
a baptism event if one exists, then finding an LDS baptism event, and finally
a christening event, the following function is suggested.

    <synopsis>/* get_baptism(indi) returns a baptism event if found
   events CHR, BAPM, BAPL, and CHRA are considered, in that order
*/
func get_baptism(indi, prefs)
{
    set(chr, 0)
    set(bapm, 0)
    set(bapl, 0)
    set(chra, 0)
    fornodes(indi,node)
    {
	if (and(eq(upper(tag(node)), "CHR"), not(chr)) { set(chr, node) }
	if (and(eq(upper(tag(node)), "BAPM"), not(bapm)) { set(bapm, node) }
	if (and(eq(upper(tag(node)), "BAPL"), not(bapl)) { set(bapl, node) }
	if (and(eq(upper(tag(node)), "CHRA"), not(chra)) { set(chra, node) }
    }
    if (chr) { return(chr) }

Three functions are available for to generate <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym>
format output to the report output file of all persons in the argument
person set.  These functions do not in most cases generate consistent
and usable output.  This can be done with a program, but it is 
suggested that these routines are probably not what you really wanted.
</para>
<para>
<function>Gengedcom</function> 
output contains a person record for each person in the set,
and all the family records that
link at least two of the persons in the set together.
This function is provided for backward compatibility. Source, Event and
Other(X) record pointers are output unmodified, but none of their records
are output - this yields an inconsistent output.

<para>
<function>Gengedcomweak</function> 
output does not contain Source, Event or Other(X) record pointers

By the release of version 3.0.6, all string values are local copies, and the <function>save</function> and
<function>strsave</function> functions should be entirely unnecessary.
<function>Save</function> is present only for compatibility reasons. Previously it duplicated its argument (to prevent strings
from becoming stale; this is not currently necessary (and this function no longer does anything).
 <function>Strsave</function> is the same function as <function>save</function>.
