# Why do we use expect?
# normal file operations like "echo string | llexec ..."
#    make stdin to llines a pipe, not a tty. 
# curses doesn't process terminal specific key operations (like Up Key,
#    Down Key) unless the input is a tty.
# expect - opens a tty to communicate with the spawned program.
# The test suite forces xterm as the terminal type.
# So this script allows checking special key processing, assuming
#    the xterm key specifications rather than having curses ignoring
#    the special nature and having llines ignore the data as unexpected keys.
# Note llexec doesn't work with the up/down keys as it doesn't use curses.

# expect is somewhat percular in processing data returned from the 
# spawned program. Instead of introducing delays with send_human
# or send_slow, both witch introduce dealys
#set send_human {.1 .3 1 .1 .2} /
#set send_human {.01 .1 1 .01 .1}  # 99 sec
#set send_slow {1 .001}
#    # 90 sec
# 5 values in send_human, 1. default, 2.  word endings, 
#     3. measure of ariability(.1 quite variable 1 reasonably variable,
#        10 quite invariable), last 2 4. min and 5. max values 

# make it simpler to change send options.
