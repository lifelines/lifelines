******************************
1. General (UNIX) installation
******************************

This is the source distribution of the LifeLines system, a genealogy
software system.

LifeLines should compile correctly using GNU gcc or any native C compiler.
It also will build using the Cygnus tools on Windows (but see note in the
platform notes section below).

In all cases, various dependencies are required.  (See section 1a.)

If you have downloaded a "release" package, do the following:

	sh ./configure
	make
	make install

If you have downloaded a "source code" package, or have cloned the git
repository directly, do the following:

	sh build/autogen.sh
	sh ./configure
	make
	make install

If you want to keep the build area separate from the source area
replace the configure and make commands with

      mkdir bld64
      cd bld64
      ../configure --with-64bit
      make
      make install

and likewise you can build a 32 bit executables by replacing 64 with 32 above.

This will generate Makefiles suitable for your platform and then build
and install the LifeLines programs.  You will end up with the following
executables (installed in various places, depending on your platform):

llines   -- main LifeLines system program
llexec   -- non-interactive version, useful for running reports
dbverify -- checks a LifeLines database for problems
btedit   -- general purpose btree edit program
lldump   -- dumps the database contents in symbolic format

llines is the main LifeLines program.

llexec is a non-interactive version of the main program, and is
handy for automatically running reports against a given database.

dverify can be used to verify the correctness of a LifeLines database. This
is handy if you're storing databases on floppies, a USB stick (which may have
been improperly removed at some point), or just for peace of mind.

btedit is an administration tool used for unmangling mangled databases,
and is extremely powerful.  You should only use this program under the
expert guidance of a LifeLines developer.

lldump is an administration tool used for diagnosing mangled databases.
You should only use this program under the expert guidance of a LifeLines
developer, or if you're curious about the internal database format.

****************
1a) Dependencies
****************

lifelines has a number of dependencies and they vary depending on
how you obtain and build lifelines.

1. Generic

   ncursesw (or any curses with wide character support)

2. National Language Support (NLS)

   Use of NLS, or regeneration of the language files, requires the following:

   gettext (or gettext-devel)
   iconv (or libiconv)

   By default, NLS support is enabled.  If you want to disable NLS support,
   run configure with the '--disable-nls' option.

3. Building from source code repository

   If you are building directly from the source code repository, and
   not from a release package, you will require these tools:

   automake
   autoconf
   bison (2.7+ or 3.1+)

4. Building documentation

   Generation of the documentation requires tools to convert from xml to html,
   pdf, and text.  Currently the tools being used are:

   xmlto
   dblatex
   lynx or links
   texlive-lang-european (Debian / Ubuntu)
   texlive-cmap (Fedora / RHEL / CentOS / SLES)

   By default, these tools are not required.  If you want to edit and rebuild
   documentation, run configure with the '--with-docs' option.


*******************
1b) Specific Issues
*******************

1. gettext

  If configure succeeds, but make fails very early with an error like so:

  cd ../../po && rm -f da.gmo && : -c --statistics -o da.gmo da.po
  mv: cannot stat `t-da.gmo': No such file or directory
  ...

  Then you probably do not have the gettext tools -- the command-line
  tools needed for development, which are needed to compile, and
  are generally a separate package from the runtime libraries needed
  by running programs.

2. bison

  If you run into problems compiling yacc.c, this is likely due to an
  incompatibility between the generated files created by bison that are
  shipped with the release packages and checked into the github repo.

  To resolve these problems, ensure that you have a supported version of
  bison installed, remove yacc.c and yacc.h and rebuild.  These files will
  be regenerated using the bison that is installed on your system which
  should resolve the problem.

3. expect, bash

  The test suite needs expect and bash to be installed. These may or may
  not be part of the default install on your system.  Both need to be
  installed for the test suite to function properly..

*************
1c) Compilers
*************

Recent versions of gcc and clang build the source cleanly, although there may
be plenty of warnings.

**************************
2. Platform specific notes
**************************

***********************
2a) Platforms supported
***********************

Most UNIX-derived Linux/BSD/MacOS systems should be supported out-of-the-box
with the tarball (lifelines-x.y.z.tar.gz) distribution.

The primary development platforms are Ubuntu 22.04 and FreeBSD 13.3.

*********************
2b) Microsoft Windows
*********************

For installing the binary distribution on MS-Windows, refer to the
file Install.LifeLines.Windows.txt included in that distribution
(& also included in the docs subdirectory of the source
distributions).

For compiling from source on MS-Windows, if using cygwin, refer to
the General (UNIX) instruction above (and see also the cygwin note
below). If using MS Visual C++, you may use the project files
included in the subdirectories beneath /win32/msvc6 (which are
currently used by Perry to generate the binaries in the MS-Windows
binary distribution).

**********
2c) Cygwin
**********

Cygwin is a UNIX environment for MS-Windows.
    http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin
The lines around the boxes in the lifelines curses GUI use OEM
box characters, and so only display correctly with this setting:
    export CYGWIN=codepage:oem
This of course affects the console code page. If all your data is
ASCII, this solution may work fine for you. Otherwise, you may
invoke llines with the -z switch to suppress curses graphics, and
use primitive ASCII graphics. This is not particularly attractive,
but is usable. Suggestions are welcome.
Note that the -z commandline switch was added after the 3.0.9
release.

To compile libiconv on cygwin, I had to compile it statically, eg,
(in libiconv directory)
   ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared

****************
2d) RPM packages
****************

The source distribution includes the spec file to create rpm
packages.

*******************
2e) Debian packages
*******************

Christian Perrier maintains a Debian port of linux.
See https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=lifelines&searchon=names&suite=stable&section=all

****************
2f) FreeBSD port
****************

LifeLines is included in the FreeBSD ports collection in misc/lifelines.

************
2g) Mac OS X
************

As of lifelines-3.2.0, LifeLines is fully supported on on 64-bit MacOSX.

When installing packages from homebrew, you need to unlink and relink the
binaries so that they take precedence over those found in the base system.

eg:
brew unlink bison && brew link bison --force
brew unlink gettext && brew link gettext --force
brew unlink bash && brew link bash --force
